EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - BROILING HOT DAY

As the film's OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE plays, complete with its own
SPAGHETTI WESTERN THEME SONG, we see SEVEN shirtless and shoeless
BLACK MALE SLAVES connected together with LEG IRONS, being run,
by TWO: WHITE MALE HILLBILLIES on HORSEBACK.

The location is somewhere in Texas. The Black Men (ROY, BIG SID,
BENJAMIN, DJANGO, PUDGY RALPH, FRANKLYN, and BLUEBERRY) are slaves just
recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville
Mississippi. The White Hillbillies are two Slave Traders called,
The SPECK BROTHERS (ACE and DICKY).

One of the seven slaves is our hero DJANGO... . he's fourth in the leg
iron line. We may or may not notice a tiny small "r" burned into his
cheek ("r" for runaway), but we can't help but notice his back which
has been SLASHED TO RIBBONS by Bull Whip Beatings.

As the Operatic Opening Theme Song plays, we see a MONTAGE of misery
and pain, as Django and the Other Men are walked through blistering
sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip. Bare feet
step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles. Leg Irons take the
skin off ankles.

AS The CREDITS play, DJANGO has a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK.
Now Spaghetti Western Flashbacks are never pretty, it's usually the
time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most
painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters
from his past. In this instance we see Django in a SLAVE PEN at the
Greenville Auction.

DJANGO
Amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of the
cell door, his wife BROOMHILDA being led to the auction block.

He fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the distance,
he can see Broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the distance he
hears the Auctioneer yell; "Sold." Then she's taken away to whereabouts
unknown, never to be seen again.

As the sun continues to beat down on Django's head, he remembers;

DJANGO in the SLAVE PEN
with what seems like a one hundred and fifty Slaves in a cell designed
for forty.

WHITE MEN yank him out. of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and lead him
down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area
circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the
structure.

The ground floor is covered by the BIG MONEY BUYERS who stand in front
of the auction block.









2

DJANGO
is moved into a line of SLAVES (The Black Men), and their MASTERS
(their White Owners), and their SELLERS (the White Man actually doing
the sales pitch on the auction block), as they wait for their turn on
the block.
A SLAVE (ROBBIE), stand on the auction block in view of the room full
of Buyers, The SELLER sells, and the OWNERS stand off to the side.

DJANGO
takes in the environment around him. Django has never cared for white
folks, but these white folks are in particularly ugly.

It's DJANGO's turn ON THE AUCTION BLOCK
as the THEME SONG wails its tragic crescendo, Django is brought up on
the auction block. He.looks down at all the WHITE PEOPLE who want to
buy Niggers, who look up to him.
His heart fills with poison.

BACK TO DJANGO
walking in Leg Irons with his six Other Companions, walking across the
blistering Texas panhandle... .remembering.. .thinking. - .hating.

THE OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE
end.


/--" EXT - WOODS -- NIGHT

It's night time and The Speck Brothers, astride HORSES, keep pushing
their black skinned cargo forward.
It's a very pitch black night, with only a few stars in the.sky to
create a little top light. It's so dark, the Slavers use the creek.bed
to keep from getting lost. Both Speck Brothers carry a lantern up on
their horse, as. does Roy, the Slave in lead position on the chain gang.
It's also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven slaves,
two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air. In fact the
seven chained together Slaves, with the lead one holding a lantern, and
all of them chugging out smoky breath, and. slightly moving in unison,
resemble a human locomotive.
The Slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs, both Speck
Brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings, and white
fur collars.

WHEN...
.A SOUND and a SMALL LIGHT appears ahead of them on the road. This
makes the Slave Traders stop their human live stock, and ready their
rifles for possible trouble.









3

A BLACK HORSE
carrying a dressed in grey Rider, CLIP-CLOPS from the background to the
foreground, illuminated by a glowing lantern that the Rider carries.

THE RIDER
appears to be a tenderfoot, due to his style of dress. A long grey
winter'coat, over a grey three piece business suit, and a grey bowler
hat on his head.

DICKY SPECK
Who's that stumblin around in the dark?
State your business, or prepare to get
winged!

THE RIDER
Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no
harm. I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
The Rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front
of the two Slavers, and their Slaves, lifting the lantern up to his
face. He speaks with a slight German accent.

THE RIDER
(to the Slavers)
Good cold evening gentlemen.
(to the shivering Slaves)
Good evening-I'm looking for a pair of
slave traders that go by the'name of
The Speck Brothers. Might that be you?

ACE SPECK
Who wants to. know?

THE RIDER
I do. I'm Dr. King Schultz, and this
is my horse, Fritz.
Fritz, does a little bow with his head, a neat trick the doctor taught
him.

DICKY SPECK
You a doctor?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Affirmative.

DICKY SPECK
What kinda doctor?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Dentist. Are you The Speck Brothers, and did you
purchase those men at The Greenville.Slave Auction?

ACE SPECK
So what?









LE
Dr.SCHULTZ
So, I wish to parley with you.

ACE SPECK
Speak English!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, I'm sorry. Please forgive me, it is a
second language. Amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe, is a specimen
I'm keen to acquire.
(to the slaves)
Hello you poor devils. Is there one among
you, who was formerly a resident of
The Carrucan Plantation?
Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second
half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness. In the darkness a
VOICE rings out;

DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.
Dr.Schultz moves Fritz forward towards the darkness, raises his
lantern, illuminating our hero Django.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid! And what's your name young, man?

DJANGO
Django.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Wunderbar! You're exactly the one I'm looking
for. So tell me Django - by the way that's a
amazing name - during your time at the
Carrucan Plantation, did you come to know
three overseers by the name of The Brittle
Brothers?
Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.Schultz is delighted.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Big John, Ellis, and little brother Raj?

DJANGO
Dem da Brittle Brothers.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So Django, do you think you could recognize -
ï¿½. The Speck Brothers have been watching this tenderfoot engage their
Slave in polite conversation.. .with a touch of disbelief.









ACE SPECK
Hey, stop talkin' to him like that!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Like what?

ACE SPEC
Like that!
Dr.SCHULTZ
My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain

ACE SPECK
Speak English, goddamit!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Everybody calm down! I'm simply a customer
trying to conduct a transaction.

ACE SPECK
I don't care, no sale. Now off wit ya!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Don't be ridiculous, of course they're for
sale.
Ace raises his rifle towards the German.

ACE SPECK
Move it!
Ace cocks back the rifle hammer.
Dr.SCHULTZ
My good man, did you simply get carried away
with your dramatic gesture, or are you
pointing that weapon at me with lethal
intention...?

ACE SPECK
Last chance, fancy pants
Dr.SCHULTZ
- Very well -
The doctor, throws his lantern to the ground, enveloping him in
darkness.
The next FLASH OF LIGHT we see is the good doctors PISTOL out of his
holster, and FIRING point blank into Ace Specks face...
.BLOWING the dumber dumb brother off his horse, dead in the dirt.








Before Dicky can maneuver either his rifle or his horse in the Germans
direction...

BAM...
Dr.SCHULTZ SHOOTS his HORSE in the head...
.The Steed goes down taking Dicky with him...
When the dead weight horse lands on Dicky's slightly twisted leg, we
hear TWO DISTINCT CRACKING SOUNDS.:..
Dicky lets out a bitch like scream.
The Slaves watch all this. They've never seen a white man kill another
white man before.
Dicky is pinned down under his ole paint.
Django watches in the dark, the German climb down off his horse,
pick up Ace's discarded lantern, and walk over to the remaining Speck.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Sorry about putting a bullet in your beast.
But I didn't want you to do anything rash
before you had a moment to come to your senses.
Dr.Sch.ultz LIGHTS the lantern, illuminating himself, as he stands over
Dicky's body.

DICKY SPECK
You goddamn son of a bitch, you killed Ace!
Dr.SCHULTZ.
I only shot your brother, once he threatened
to shoot me. And I do believe I have ...

(COUNTING OUT

THE SLAVES)
.one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven witnesses who can attest to that fact.

DICKY SPECK
My damn legs busted!
Dr.SCHULTZ
No doubt. Now, if you can keep your
caterwauling down to a minimum, I'd like
to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.

(TO DJANGO)
As I was saying, if you were to see
the Brittle Brothers again, would you
recognize them?

DJANGO
Yes.








Dr.SCHULTZ
Now I'm sure. to you, all unshaven white men
look alike. So Django, in a crowd of
unshaven white men, can you honestly
and positively point out The Brittle Brothers?

DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
We're in his little shack at the Carrucan Plantation. It's PISSING RAIN
outside. Django is making love to his wife Broomhilda, when she stops
letting out a shout. The three overseers known as THE BRITTLE BROTHERS
are outside peeking in through the window. They BURST in through the
front door. Soaked to the bone, they rodeo bull their way into the
shack, and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement.
As Django and Broomhilda are forced to copulate, they run their wet
white hands down her chocolate leg.. .they fondle his ass.. .they squeeze
her tit. . .they bring a belt across Django's backside to make him fuck
faster. . .then they yank him off, as BIG JOHN climbs on top of
Broomhilda..the other Brittle brothers whip Django with their belts,
and make him sit in the corner, while they finish with his wife.

BACK TO DJANGO

DJANGO
I can point 'em out.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Sold American! So Mr.Speck, how much for
Django?

DICKY SPECK
I'm gonna lose this leg!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, unless you find a talented physician
very quickly, I'm afraid that will be the.
end result. But back to business, how much
do you want for Django?

DICKY SPECK
You go to hell!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Don't be silly. How much for Django?

DICKY SPECK
800 dollars!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh come now, I may not have the experience in
the slave trade that you and your family does,
but neither was I born yesterday.

The. good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket.
Dr.SCHULTZ
In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked
up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says
that the going rate for African flesh'
- in particularly a field nigger -_is sixty
to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as
Django is, technically, he is a field. nigger.
Which according to"this pamphlet here - and
why would they lie - puts his price at
eighty dollars. So in light of that, how
bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for
young Django here.
Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a
one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And since your late brother. won't be using
it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag.
He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on
Dicky's body. He bends down and, puts the paper money-.in the saddle bags
on Dicky's dead horse. With.his hands in there, he roots around and
finds the keys to-the leg irons. He unlocks Django's leg irons.
Django is free.
Dr.SCHULTZ
There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good
rubbing, then get up on that horse.
Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter
coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
Django removes the coat from the dead slaver. Puts on the warm jacket
over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse.
Dr.Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a
bill of sale. Do you have one?
Dicky just curses him.
He says, removing a notebook from his pocket;
Dr.SCHULTZ
I thought not. No worries, I come prepared.
(as he writes)
This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
(he stops, then
says to Django)
Django is spelled with a silent "D",
is it not?









9

DJANGO
Huh?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Why not..
He writes it in his book with a silent "D", then stops to admire the
way it looks.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, that does add a little character.
The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down
under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen.
Dr.SCHULTZ
If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make your
mark here.
The. Hillbilly spits in the German gentleman's face. The good doctor
wipes his face with a handkerchief. Then takes out a pocket knife.
And whispers something that can't be heard in the slavers ear.
He signs the bill of sale.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Speck, I would like to say it was a
pleasure doing business with you, but your
customer service leaves a lot to be desired.
The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz, and looks to the six Slaves, in
leg irons.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Now as to you poor devils.
He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So as I.see it, when it comes to the subject
of what to do next, you gentlemen have two
choices. One, once I'm gone, you lift that
beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him
to the nearest town. Which would be at least
thirty-seven miles back the way you came.
Or ...
.Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that
rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep, and make your way
to a more enlightened area of the country.
The choice is yours.
He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds;









0
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, and on the off chance that there's
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,
the North Star is THAT ONE. Tata.
He looks to Django, who doesn't know how to start his horse.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Just give him a little kick.
Django does, and the horse responds by moving.
Dr.SCHULTZ
See, it's not so difficult.

EXT - MORNING TEXAS LANDSCAPE - SUNRISE
The DAWN BREAKS on a western landscape. The two men ride their horses
silently, horse hooves CLIP-CLOPPING among the rocks. Django wears
Specks winter coat, with one of Dr.Schultz's white button down dress
shirts underneath it. As they ride through the picturesque scene...
Dr.Schultz breaks the silence.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So, Django, what do you intend to name him?

DJANGO
Who?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Your horse?

DJANGO
What horse?
Dr.SCHULTZ'
The horse you're riding.

DJANGO
This ain't my horse.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes it is.

DJANGO
No it ain't, it's your horse. I'm just riding
it.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, technically, yes - Wait a minute -
technically not. If it's my horse, I can
give it to you, and as of now, I'm doing such.
Django, you're now the proud owner of a horse,
congratulations.









/1

DJANGO
I can't feed no horse. I can't put no horse
up in no stable.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(FRUSTRATED)
Don't worry about all that!
They ride a bit longer in silence.. .the good doctor composes himself...
then says with a smile;
Dr.SCHULTZ
So... . now that that's settled... . what do you
intend to name it? Half the fun of having
a horse is choosing his name. For instance
my steed is named Fritz. He's stubborn,
ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but I
couldn't do without him.
(he pats Fritz's neck)
Anyway, the name of one's steed, isn't
something one does lightly. So once you've
thought about it for awhile -

DJANGO
- Tony.
Dr.SCHULTZ
- Tony what?

DJANGO
- I dunno, Tony the horse.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, you mean you want to name your horse
Tony?

DJANGO
Yeah. That's what you jus' asked me, right?
Dr.SCHULTZ
When you're right you're right, indeed I did.
Why Tony?

DJANGO
I gotta tell ya? You didn't tell me I gotta
tell ya.
As they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a
western town. They pass by a sign that says; "WELCOME TO DAUGHTREY,

TEXAS"









/Z
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well I'm naturally curious, of course, but
there's no reason you MUST tell me. In fact
an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to
any steed. And I do believe Tony wears it
well. Good job Django, well done.

EXT - THE WESTERN TOWN OF DAUGHTREY - MORNING
As the citizens of Daughtrey wake up, Django and Dr.Schultz ride Fritz
and Tony through the main street of town..Daughtrey looks like a
million western towns we've seen before in movies. But to the
TOWNSPEOPLE of Daughtrey, Django and the German don't look like a
million other visitors.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What's everybody staring at?

DJANGO
They never seen a nigger on a horse before.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What's this bizarre obsession they have
with. you not riding horses?

DJANGO
You askin' me?
Dr.Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts. Django has
a little trouble both stopping Tony and getting off him, but it gets
done. Dr.Schultz keeps bombarding The Slave with questions.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So what other archaic rituals are you people
verboten to take part in?
As per usual with this white man, Django thinks; "What"?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm just trying to get a clear idea on what
you can do, and what you can't do, and if
you can't do it, why can't you do it?
Like for instance, what if we were to walk
in this saloon here, sit down at a table,
order a drink, and drink it?
Would the authorities frown on that?

DJANGO
Hell yeah, they gonna frown.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What part would they find the most offensive?









13

DJANGO
All of it. I can't be walkin' in no saloon.
I can't be sittin' my ass on no chair,
at no table. I can't be drinkin' no drink.
And I definitely can't be sharin' no drink,
with no white man, in public.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So if you and I did those things, that would
be considered enough of a infraction to make
the saloon keeper go get the sheriff?

DJANGO
You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff.
The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well in that case Django, after you.

DJANGO
Whoa - I ain't funnin, I can't go in there.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django you're going to have to learn to trust
me, and as the man said; "There's no time
like the,present."
He takes Django by the arm and leads him into the entryway of the
establishment.

INT - SALOON - MORNING
The nervous black slave and the confident German'dentist walk into the
saloon.
The SALOON KEEPER (PETE) is high up on a chair placed high up on a
table, to change a candle in the saloons chandelier. His back is turned
away from the two patrons.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good morning inn keeper, two beers for two
weary travelers.

SALOON KEEPER
It',s still pretty early, we won't be open
for about a hour. But by then we'll be
servin' breakfast -
He turns around and sees them.

SALOON KEEPER
Whoa! What the hell you think you doin' boy,
get that nigger outta here.









IT

TIME CUT

EXT - SALOON - MORNING
It's about five minutes later, and the Saloon Keeper comes running out
of the bar to get the Sheriff.
When Dr.Schultz, sitting at a table with the young Django, calls;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Inn keeper! Remember, get the sheriff, not
the marshall. This wouldn't be the marshalls
jurisdiction.'This is just a infraction,
on what I assume is a simple county ordinance,
and that would fall under the domain of the
Sheriff.
The Saloon Keeper runs away.
The two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon.
Dr.SCHULTZ
It looks like we must act as our own bartender.
The German stands up, and walks-behind the bar, and pours two beer's
from the tap into mugs. Django remains seated, and after a beat, asks;

DJANGO
What kinda dentist are you?
This makes the doctor laugh, as he pours the beer's.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I haven't practiced dentistry in five years -
Not to say once I know you better, I wouldn't
like to get a look at that mouth - I'm sure
it's a disaster - But these days I practice
a new profession ... . Bounty Hunter.
This gets no reaction from Django.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is?
The Black Man shakes his head, no.
As the good doctor, walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer,

HE EXPLAINS;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well the way the slave trade deals in
human lives for cash, a bounty hunter,
deals in corpses.









15
Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
The state places a bounty on a man's head.
I track that man, I find that man, I kill
that man. After I've killed him, I transport
that man's corpse back to the authorities -
and sometimes that's easier said then done.
I show that corpse to the authorities -
proving, yes indeed, I have truly killed him
- At which point, the authorities pay me
the bounty.
(lifting his beer)
Cheers.
The two men touch glasses, and take a drink.

DJANGO
What's a bounty?
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's like a reward.

DJANGO
You kill people and they give you a reward?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Certain people, yes.

DJANGO
White people?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mostly. A few Mexicans. Couple Chinamen.

DJANGO
Bad people?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Badder they are, bigger the reward.
Which brings me to you, and I must admit
I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes
to you. On one hand, I despise slavery.
On the other hand, I need your help,
and if you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better. So for the time being,
I'm going to make this slave malarkey
work to my benefit.

(BEAT)
Still... . having said that, .I feel guilty.
So... I'd like the two of us to enter into
an agreement. I'm looking for The Brittle Brothers,
however in this endeavor I'm at a slight
disadvantage, in so far as, I don't know
what they look like. But you do... .dont'cha?

ï¿½. DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
Django, back at The Carrucan Plantation, held down by Roger and Ellis
Brittle, as Big John BURNS the "r" into his cheek with a BRANDING IRON.

BACK TO DJANGO

DJANGO
I know what they look like, all right.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good. So, here's my agreement. You travel
with me till we find them -

DJANGO
- Where we goin'?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I hear at least two of them are overseeing
up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.
That means we visit every plantation in
Gatlinburg till we find them. And when we
find them, you point them out, and I kill
them. You do that, I agree to give you
your freedom... . twenty-five dollars per
Brittle brother - that's seventy-five
dollars... . your horse, Tony even though
I've already gave him to you -- but once the
final Brittle brother lies dead in the
dust, I'll buy you a new saddle, and a
new suit of clothes, handsome cowboy hat
included.
Dr.Schultz's eyes go to the saloon window.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And as if on cue... . here comes the sheriff.

EXT - SALOON - MORNING
We see the sheriff, BILL SHARP, walk towards the saloon cradling a
Winchester. Some TOWNSPEOPLE (like the Saloon Keeper) stand around to
watch. A. YOUNG BOY leads a herd of BABY GOATS through town.
Sheriff Sharp stands in the middle of the street.

SHERIFF SHARP
Okay boys, fun's over, come on out.
Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch.
As they do, The Sheriff says;









1 2

SHERIFF SHARP
Now why y'all wanna come into my town,
start trouble, and scare all these nice
people? You ain't got nothin' better to
do, then to come into Bill Sharps town
and show your ass -
From his top step on the porch, Dr. King Schultz extends his hand
toward the sheriff, as if to shake it... :.

.THEN...
A SMALL DERRINGER - POPS into Schultz's hand from a metal sliding
apparatus concealed under his jacket sleeve. Once in hand, the dentist
FIRES one tiny bullet into the belly of Bill Sharp.
The tiny gun makes a tiny POP sound.
The shocked Bill Sharp lets out a ugly groan, and doubles over in the
dirt.
The TOWNSPEOPLE are startled.
As is Django.
As Schultz walks down the porch steps, to the fallen sheriff, reloading
his tiny pop shooter, a PEDESTRIAN yells out;

PEDESTRIAN
What did you jus' do to our sheriff?
Dr.Schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law man's
skull, killing him dead.
In the background, ONE WOMAN faints. The Boy and his Goats scatter.
Dr.Schultz looks over at the Saloon Keeper, across the street.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Now you can go get the marshall.

TIME CUT

EXT - DAUGHTREY MAIN STREET - DAY
U.S.MARSHALL GILL TATUM snaps the MENFOLK OF Daughtrey to attention.

MARSHALL TATUM
Move that buckboard over there long ways
across the street from the saloon. And I
want six men and six Winchesters behind it.
And I want two men with two rifles on this
roof, and two men with two rifles on that
roof, with all barrels pointed at that
front door. And somebody git poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.









LP
Cowboys with rifles climb up stairs to take position on the roof of the
building across the street from the saloon.
The Marshall directs the buckboard being moved into place.
The last SNIPER on the rooftop takes his position.

WHEN...

COMING FROM THE SALOON... . PIANO MUSIC ...

INT - SALOON - DAY
Dr.Schultz sits behind the piano playing a catchy little saloon number.
He seems skilled enough to be a professional western saloon piano
player. A terrified Django, who's sure his new master is a lunatic
who's going to get them both killed, peeks out the closed curtains
on the window.
Dr.Schultz's suit coat sits draped over a chair. All of his weapons,
including his metal sliding rail Derringer contraption, lie on a table.
He plays piano in his button down dress shirt and gray suit vest.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What are they doing?

DJANGO
I think they wonderin' why you playin'
the piana'.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good.

(PAUSE)
But what are they doing?

DJANGO
A buncha white folks brought a buckboard
around out front, now they hidin' behind it
with guns. And a buncha other white folks
are up on the roof, with rifles pointed
down here.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Damn, they got that organized fast. Is the
marshall out there?

DJANGO
If the one I think is the.marshall is the
marshall, he's out there.









)9
Dr.SCHULTZ
What makes you think he's the marshall?

DJANGO
Cause he's the one ready to say somethin'.

MARSHALL'S VOICE
You in the saloon!
Dr.Schultz stops playing the piano.

MARSHALL'S VOICE
We got eleven Winchesters on every way
outta that buildin'! You got once chance
git outta this alive! You and your nigger
come out right now with your hands over
your head, and I mean, right now!
Dr.SCHULTZ
First things first! Is this the marshall
I have the pleasure of addressing?

MARSHALL TATUM
Yes it is, this is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Wunderbar! So marshall, I have relieved
myself of all weapons, and just as you
have instructed, I'm ready to step outside
with my hands raised above my head.
I trust as a representative of the
criminal justice system of The United
States of America, I shant be shot down
in the street, by either you or your deputies,
before I've had my day in court.

MARSHALL TATUM
You mean like you did our sheriff? Shot
'em down like a dog in the street!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, that's exactly what I mean! Do I
have your word as a lawman not to shoot
me down like a dog in the street?

MARSHALL TATUM
Well, as much as we'd all enjoy seein'
somethin' like that, ain't nobody gonna
cheat the hangman in my town!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Fair enough marshall, here we.come.!








Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO DJANGO)
They're a little tense out there. So don't
make any quick movements, and let me do
the talking.
Django looks at him like, "as if..."

EXT - SALOON/MAIN STREET - DAY
A lot of guns are trained on the front door of the saloon.
Outside of range, the WHOLE TOWN watches the stand off.
The saloon doors open, and Dr.Schultz and Django, hands raised, step
outside.

MARSHALL TATUM
You unarmed?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes indeed we are. Marshall Tatum, may I
address you, your deputies, and apparently
the entire town of Daughtrey, as to the
incident that just occurred?

MARSHALL TATUM
Go on!
Dr.SCHULTZ
My name is Dr.King Schultz. And like
yourself, marshall, I am a servant of the
court. The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit
to elect as their sheriff, who went by
the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a
wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck,
with a price on his head of two hundred
dollars. That's two hundred dollars, dead
or alive.

MARSHALL TATUM
The hell you say!
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'.m aware this is probably disconcerting
news. But I'm willing to wager this man
was elected sheriff sometime in the last
two years. I know this because. three years
ago he was rustling cattle from,
The B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company of
Lubbock Texas.









Z/
Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
In my possession. is a warrant made out by
circuit court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk
of Austin Texas. You are encouraged to wire him.
He will back up who I am, and who your
dear departed sheriff was.
The Menfolk of the town with rifles, begin trading looks. Then
Dr.Schultz delivers the coup de grace.
Dr.SCHULTZ
In other words marshall, you owe me
two hundred dollars.

CUT TO

EXT - TENNESSEE COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
Django and Dr.Schultz, who by now have ridden quite a few miles
together, ride their horses in the Tennessee countryside, on the way to
Gatlinburg. Dr.Schultz is dressed in one of his nearly identical grey
business suits, and Django is still dressed in his slave pants,
Schultz's button down dress shirt, and Ace Speck's winter coat.
Somewhere along the way a pair of shoes have appeared on'his feet.
Dr.SCHULTZ
One needs a plan, son. These are brutal
times. A man who survives, is a man with
a plan. A man who thrives, is a man with
a good plan. So, having said that, what's
your plan, young Django?

DJANGO
What'cha mean?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, after this Brittle business is behind
us, you'll be a free man, with a horse, and
seventy five dollars in your back pocket.
What's your plan after that?

DJANGO
Find my wife, and buy her freedom.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django, I had no idea you were a married man.
Do most slaves take the institution of
matrimony seriously?

DJANGO
Huh?









ZZ
Dr.SCHULTZ
Do slaves believe in marriage'?

DJANGO
Me and my wife do.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Where is she now?

DJANGO
I dunno. They put us in different boxcars,
and sent U.S to The Greenville Slave Auction.
She got sold two days 'fore me.
But I don't know who to.
Dr.Schultz takes out a long stick of beef jerky.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Care for some jerky?

DJANGO
Sure.
Dr.Schultz rips him off a piece. Django chews on it. As he chews,

SCHULTZ SAYS;
Dr.SCHULTZ
So your plan is to trackdowri your wife, and
purchase her.freedom? Only you don't know
where she is?
A chewing Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.Schultz, takes a big bite of jerky, chews for a "moment contemplating
the dilemma, then pronounces;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well that shouldn't be all that difficult.
So how long ago did all this happen?

DJANGO
A few months ago.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Three or four?

DJANGO
Three.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So shecamefrom the Carrucan Plantation,
and shewassold at The Greenville Slave
Auctiontosome :unknown customer three
monthsago?
Django nods his head, yes.









Z3
Dr.SCHULTZ
The bad part about slavery being a business,
is it's immoral. The good part about it being
a business is, they keep records. Somewhere
in Greenville there's a book with your wife's
name in it, and the name of the customer who
bought her, and more then likely their address.
But then Schultz seems to get second thoughts.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Still, seventy-five dollars in your back
pocket is a pretty nice grub steak, but it's
not going to get you very far in Greenville.
Not to mention a slave auction town in
Mississippi isn't the safest place you could
visit. Free or not.

DJANGO
I'll have my freedom papers.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes you will. But say you show them to some
rascals, and they take them from you and
tear them up?

DJANGO
They could do that?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm not saying they would, but they could.

DJANGO
They do that I'll kill 'em.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Great! Now you get hung for killin' a white
man. The point being is the place,is just
too dangerous for you.

DJANGO
Well I gotta go, when do I go?
Dr.SCHULTZ
When you get more dangerous.

EXT - CHATTANOOGA - DAY
Muddy and wet big city Chattanooga. We're in the back of a STORE that.
sells SERVANT/HOUSE NIGGER UNIFORMS. Django comes bursting out of the
stores back door. He's very distressed. One glance at the outfit he's
wearing explains the distress.









Z

DJANGO
is dressed in a powder blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, that
wouldn't be out of place in the court of Marie Antoinette at
Versailles.
Dr.Schultz comes trailing after him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django, you have to, it's part of "The Act".
You're playing a character. Your character
is The Valet. This is what The Valet wears.
Remember what I told you. During the act,
you can never break character.

CUT TO

EXT - BENNETT MANOR- DAY
We see Dr. Schultz, riding slightly in front of Django, dressed in his
blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, as they enter the property of
BENNETT MANOR, a plantation in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Django leads a
riderless horse, behind him and Tony.
As the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front
steps of Bennett Manor, alongside the cotton fields, all the SLAVES
stop picking cotton, and straighten their bent backs up to stare in
wonder at this sight.
The patriarch of Bennett Manor, SPENCER "BIG DADDY" BENNETT, dressed in
a fancy leisure suit of the day, emerges from the double doors of the
mansion, and stands on the top steps, hands on hips, watching the white
man and black man move from the background to the foreground.
While there are plenty BLACK MALES out in the cotton fields, the
majority of the slave population of Bennett Manor is pretty.BLACK
FEMALES, fourteen to twenty-four, referred to as, "PONY'S".
The biggest money making crop of this farm, after cotton.
As Dr.Schultz and fancy pants Django, bring Fritz and Tony to a stop
in front of Bennett Manor, they've drawn quite a crowd of SLAVES,
BENNETT FAMILY MEMBERS, and WHITE WORKERS (OVERSEER'S).
Spencer Bennett keeps on the top step so he won't be forced to look up
at the darkee on the horse.

SPENCER BENNETT
It's against the law for niggers to ride
horses in this territory.
Dr.SCHULTZ
This is my valet, and my valet doesn't walk.

SPENCER BENNETT
I said niggers -








Z .ate`
Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Django, he's a free man, and
he can ride what he pleases.

SPENCER BENNETT
Not on my.property, around my niggers
he can't.
Dr.SCHULTZ
My good sir, perhaps we got off on the
wrong boot. Allow me to unring this bell.
My name is Dr.King Schultz, this is my
valet, Django, and these are our horses,
Fritz, and Tony.
Fritz, does his head bow.
This makes the pretty PONY'S surrounding Bennett, giggle.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, I've been lead to believe you
are a gentleman, and a business man.
And it is in these capacities that we've
ridden from Texas to Tennessee to talk
with you now.

SPENCER BENNETT
State your business.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I wish to purchase one of your
nigger gals.

SPENCER BENNETT
You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to
Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals,
no appointment, no nuttin'?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm afraid so.

SPENCER BENNETT
Well what if I say, I don't like you, or
your fancy pants. nigger, and I wouldn't
sell you a tinkers damn - what'cha gotta
say about that?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, if you are the business man,
I've been led to believe you to be,
I have five thousand things I might say,
that could change your mind.
i This gets everybody's attention, not least of all Spencer Bennett.
Spencer laughs.









ZG

SPENCER BENNETT
C'mon inside, get yourself something' cool
to drink.
The incognito bounty hunter, dismounts his steed, as does Django.
Then the good doctor walks up the steps to Bennett Manor.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Maybe while we discuss business, you
could provide one of your loveliest black
creatures to escort Django here around
your magnificent grounds.

SPENCER
Absolutely. Betina!
A pretty, fleshy, sweet jelled, twenty-two year old slave gal named
BETINA, snaps to attention.

BETINA
Yes sir, Big Daddy?

SPENCER

(TO SCHULTZ)
What's your Jimmies name again?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django.

SPENCER
Betina sugar, take Django around the
grounds. Show 'em all the pretty stuff.

BETINA
As you please, Big Daddy.
Dr.Schultz lowers his voice, and says to the plantation owner;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, I must remind, you, Django is a
free man. He cannot be treated like a slave.
Within the bounds of good taste, he must be
treated as an extension of myself.

SPENCER
Understood., Schultz. Betina?

BETINA
Yes, sir?

SPENCER
Django isn't a slave. Django is a free
man. Do you understand? You're not to treat
him like any of these other niggers around
here, cause he ain't like any of these
other niggers around here. Ya got it?









BETINA
Ya want I should treat 'em like white
folks?

SPENCER
No that's not what I said.

BETINA
Then I don't know what'cha want Big Daddy.

SPENCER
Yes, I can see that.

(HE THINKS)
What's the name of that peckawood boy from
town works with the glass? His mama works
at the lumber yard? He comes by and fixes
the winda's when we have a problem?
The MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR chimes in;

MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR
Oh, you mean Jerry.

SPENCER
Yeah, that's the boy's name, Jerry.

(TO BETINA)
You know Jerry, dont'cha sugar?

BETINA
Yes 'em, Big Daddy.

SPENCER
Well that's it then... just treat 'em
like you would Jerry.

EXT - ANOTHER PART OF BENNETT MANOR - DAY
Away from the big house, Betina gives Django a tour of the grounds.
Her in her slave get up, complete with handkerchief on her head, and
him in his satin baby blue Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, are quite
the pair. She eyeballs him disapprovingly up and down.

BETINA
What'cha do for your massa'?

DJANGO
Didn't you hear him tell ya, I ain't no slave.

BETINA
So you really free?

DJANGO
Yes.









ZY

BETINA
You mean you wanna dress like that?
Django fumes.

EXT - BENNETT MANOR (BACK PORCH) - DAY
Both Spencer Bennett and Dr.Schultz sit on the back porch drinking
lemonade.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I've been'told by those who should know,
the most exquisite African flesh in the
state of Tennessee is bred right here on
your land. And from the look of these
black angels, my sources weren't wrong.

SPENCER
Oh I got my share of, coal blacks, horse
faces, and gummy mouth bitches out in the
field. But the lion share of my lady
niggers are real show pony's.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well that's what I'm looking for, a show
pony for young Django. So the only
question that remains is, do you have a
nigger here worth five thousand dollars?

SPENCER
Dr.Schultz, five thousand dollar nigger,
is practically my middle name.

BACK TO DJANGO AND BETINA
Betina and Django walk by a big tree on the plantation grounds.
The cotton fields and the SLAVES picking it, in the background.

DJANGO
Betina, come over here, I need to ask
you something.
He moves her by the tree for more privacy. Betina thinks this fancy
pants wants to get all lovey-dovey, and she couldn't be less interested.

BETINA
What'cho want?

DJANGO
I'm lookin' for three white men. Three
brothers. Overseers. Their name is
Brittle. Do you know 'em?

BETINA
Brittle?









DJANGO
Yes, Brittle. John Brittle. Ellis Brittle.
And Roger Brittle, sometimes called, Little Raj.

BETINA
I don't know dem.

DJANGO
They could be usin' a different name.
They woulda' come to the plantation in
the last year.

BETINA
You mean The Shaffer's?

DJANGO
Maybe? Three brother?

BETINA
Ah-huh.

DJANGO
Are they here?

BETINA
Ah-huh.

DJANGO
Can you point one of 'em out to me?

BETINA
Well ones over in that field.
She points to the cotton field, at a OVERSEER on top of a horse, whip
in hand, eyeing the blacks at his mercy.
Django takes hold of a little bag slung over his shoulder opens it, and
takes out a shiny brass SPYGLASS, the type a sea captain might use.
Obviously a prop from Dr.Schultz. He slides it open, places it against
his eye, and points it in the direction of a figure out in the cotton
field landscape.

SPYGLASS POV:
Astride his nag, the filthy hillbilly, who calls himself SHAFFER, but
who Django knows to be ELLIS BRITTLE, looks on, oblivious to Django's
observation.

DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
He remembers Ellis Brittle BURNING a "r" into Broomhilda's cheek with a

BRANDING IRON.

BACK TO DJANGO AND THE SPYGLASS
he lowers the glass.









3 0

BETINA

(INNOCENTLY)
Is that who you lookin' for?

DJANGO
Yep.
He folds the spyglass back up, and puts it back in his purse.

DJANGO
Where's the other two?

BETINA.
They by the stable, punishin' Little Jody
for breakin' eggs.

DJANGO
They whippin' Little Jody?
She nods her head, yes.

DJANGO
Point me in that direction.
She points to a shed, and keeps pointing right.

BETINA
You go to that shed, and keep goin' that way.
Which means; "Go to the shed and turn right."

DJANGO
Go git that white man, I came here with.
He slaps her ass, to hurry her up.
Then looks to the shed, and begins crossing the distance between him
and The Brittle Brothers.

FLASH ON
A memory from The Carrucan Plantation; The Brittle Brothers giving his
wife Broomhilda, a peelin'.
PEELIN' : A punishment by bullwhip, across the back.
LITTLE RAJ makes a line in the dirt with the heel of his boot.
Making Django stand behind it, as he watches his wife being whipped.
BIG JOHN BRITTLE SLASHES the beauty of Broomhilda's back with his

BULLWHIP.
DJANGO, keeping behind the line, begs Big John for mercy.









3/

DJANGO
Please Big John, she won't do it no more!
She's real sorry!
The WHIP RIPS her back.

DJANGO

(SCREAMING)
Goddamit, Big John!

LITTLE RAJ
Whoa nigger, calm down, keep it funny.
Django gets on his knees, and on behalf of Broomhild.a, begs Big John
Brittle with everything he has.

BACK TO DJANGO
crossing the lawn towards The Brittle Brothers, like an express train.

FLASH ON
Big John Brittle standing over him, bullwhip in hand, saying to the

KNEELING DJANGO;

BIG JOHN BRITTLE
I like the way you beg, boy.

EXT - STABLE - DAY
Little Raj Brittle, ties LITTLE JODY, a petite slave girl (eighteen)
to a dead tree stump.
BIG JOHN BRITTLE paces, taking a few practice CRACKS with his WHIP.
LITTLE JODY begs The Shaffer Brothers/The Brittle Brothers for mercy.
ROGER goes and sits on a old wagon wheel to watch the whippin'.

BIG JOHN BRITTLE
Now Jody quit your caterwaulin'. You know
yourself it's for your own good. Niggers
are clumsy. You'd break everything in
goddamn sight, you weren't cured. And the
only known cure for nigger clumsiness
is a peelin'.
Little Jody begs to differ.

BACK TO DJANGO
As Django in his powder blue satin suit hurries across the grass to
Little Jody and The Brittle Brothers, he collects eight little friends
who happily run along with the fast walking man. EIGHT LITTLE FRENCH
BULLDOGS who bark, yelp, snort and breath at his heels.. Django pays the
little dogs no nevermind.









3 2-

BACK TO BIG JOHN BRITTLE
In position to take the skin off of Little Jody's back.

BIG JOHN
After this we'll see if you break eggs again.

DJANGO
turns the corner to the stable, and stands behind them. They don't see
him. Big John rears back to make the first WHIP LASH...

WHEN ...
.DJANGO'S VOICE, stops him;

DJANGO
John Brittle!
Big John breaks his whip stride, looks. up, and in a discarded full
length broken mirror from the big house, laying abandoned against the
stable wall, he see's DJANGO, dressed in his powder blue satin Little
Lord Flauntleroy outfit, surrounded by his pack of little French
Bulldogs.
LITTLE JODY on her knees, tied to the dead tree stump, looks up see's
the same thing in the mirror.
LITTLE RAJ looks to his left at the sounds of the voice.
BIG JOHN turns toward Django, who he still doesn't recognize.
DJANGO just stares back.
BIG JOHN smile disappears. He recognizes Django.
So does Roger.

LITTLE RAJ
Django?
Django crosses toward Big John, raising up his arm like he's going to
shake his hand ...

DJANGO
Remember me?
.Django extends his arm, and Dr.Schultz's Derringer arm
contraption,. POPS the TINY GUN into his hand, and he FIRES a tiny
bullet smack dab into BIG JOHN'S MERCILESS HEART.

BIG JOHN FACE
goes into shock... .he falls to his knees...he looks up, clutching his
heart, at Django.

DJANGO
I like the way you die, boy.









3 3
Big John hears it...then tips over dead.
LITTLE JODY can't believe what she's just seen.
FOUR OTHER SLAVES who just happen to be walking in the background, see
it.
LITTLE RAJ is stunned ... . then comes to his senses, fumbling for the
gun he wears on his hip, but since he's no gunman, in his haste, he
gets it out of his holster, but drops it on the ground.
It goes off... BANG.
SHOOTING himself in the foot, he HOPS UP AND DOWN in pain.
The Bulldogs scatter at the sound. of the BANG.
DJANGO picks Big John's WHIP off the ground., and begins WHIPPING
LITTLE RAJ across the face and chest.
MORE SLAVES gather.

DJANGO WHIPS HIM TO THE GROUND
whips him on the ground, then throws the whip to the ground, picks
Roger's pistol off the ground, and empties it (FIVE SHOTS) into Roger.
To say the slaves are flabbergasted, is a understatement.
Dr.Schultz rides his horse up quickly, rifle in his hand. He sees
Django, and the two dead bodies.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Who are they?

DJANGO
That's John Brittle, and that's his
little brother Raj.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Where's Ellis?

DJANGO
He's the one hightailin' it across that
field right now.
Ellis Brittle riding his horse full out through the cotton field trying
to make an escape.

SCHULTZ'S WINCHESTER
goes to his eye, he follows the rider with his rifle barrel.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Are you sure that's him?
Ellis gets further away...









DJANGO
Yes!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Are you positive?
Ellis gets further away...

DJANGO
I dunno.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You don't know if you're positive?
Ellis gets further away...

DJANGO
I don't know what, positive,'means.
Dr.SCHULTZ
It means you're sure.

DJANGO
Yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, what?

DJANGO
Yes I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

BAM!
The German picks the middle Brittle brother off his horse.
The dead man WIPES OUT horribly in the thick cotton brush.
RED BLOOD splashes on WHITE COTTON.
The German and Django have the entire plantation's attention.
Spencer Bennett (with his Winchester), his SONS and his OVERSEERS,
and some HOUSE NIGGERS come around like a angry mob.
The German tosses his rifle in the dirt, and raises his hands.
Django does the same with his pistol.
Dr.Schultz addresses the ANGRY MOB.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Everybody calm down, we mean no one else any harm!

SPENCER
Just who the hell are you two jokers?









35;
Drï¿½. SCHULTZ
I am Dr.King Schultz, a legal representative
of the criminal justice system of the
United States of America. The man to my
left is Django Freeman, he's my. deputy.
In my pocket is a warrant signed by circuit
court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin
Texas, for the arrest and capture, dead or
alive, of John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, and
Roger Brittle --

DJANGO
- They were goin by the name, Shaffer.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You know them by the name, Shaffer.
But the butchers real names'were Brittle.
These are wanted men. The law wants them
for murder. I reiterate, this warrant
states dead or alive. When Django and myself
executed these men on sight, we were operating
within our legal. boundaries. Now I realize
passions are high. But I must warn you,
the penalty for taking deadly force
against a officer of the court in the
performance of his duty is, you will be
hung by the neck until you are dead.
This does put a momentary pause in the lynch mob's blood lust.
After his dramatic pause for effect...
.Dr.Schultz says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
May I please remove the warrant from my
pocket so you may examine it?
Resting his Winchester over his shoulder, Bennett reaches for the
paper.

SPENCER
Gimmie.
Dr.Schultz removes the warrant from his jacket pocket, and hands it to
the plantation owner. Bennett reads it silently to himself, resigned to
what it says.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Satisfied.
Bennett eyes go from the warrant to the German.
Dr.SCHULTZ
May I have that back?









36
,- Bennett hands Schultz back the piece of paper.
Dr.SCHULTZ
We good?

BENNETT
Get off my land.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Post haste.

(TO DJANGO)
Load up the bodies as quickly as
you can, and let's get out of
here.

TIME CUT
All three dead Brittle Brothers lie over the back of the extra horse
the bounty hunters brought with them.
Both Bounty Hunters are back in their saddles ready to leave.
With all the eyes of the plantation on them, the white and black man
start to ride out, when Spencer "Big Daddy" Bennett, steps in their way
for one final threat.

BENNETT
Ain't nobody gonna touch you and your Jimmie
while you on my property. But for lettin' a
nigger kill a white man, and especially for
letting a nigger kill a white man in a
audience of niggers, y'all ain't gonna make
it out of the county alive. Mark my words
Schultz, by tomorrow morning your niggers
gonna be stripped and clipped and hangin'
from my motherfuckin' gate.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm fully aware Bennett, that you and your
regulator playmates aren't shy about
killing for what you believe in. But mark
my words Big Daddy, if you make a move
towards Django or myself, you better be
prepared to die for it.
The two men ride off.
The Black and White Audience watch them go.

CUT TO.

CU SPENCER BENNETT
lying on his belly in the grass.

SPENCER BENNETT
That's them sonsabitches.

SPENCER'S POV:
We see the camp by the lake that Dr.Schultz and Django have set up.
Both wrapped up in bedrolls. The dead bodies of the Brittle Brothers
lie by them in a pile. A campfire slowly dims.
We Cut Back to Spencer Bennett lying on his belly with SIX OTHER RIFLE
CARING MEN observing the camp, from over a grade.
The Men sneak back down the hill the way they came...
Where about TWENTY-FOUR REGULATORS are waiting for them ON HORSEBACK,
all of the riders heads are covered by FLOUR SACKS with eyes and mouth
holes cut out. Some carry TORCHES, all carry RIFLES or SHOTGUNS.
Spencer mounts his horse. "Big Daddy" issues orders astride his
steed..

SPENCER BENNETT
Now unless they start shootin' first,
nobody shoot 'em. That's way too simple
for these jokers. We're gonna whip that
nigger lover to death. And I'm gonna
personally, strip and clip that garboon
myself.
Having said his blood thirsty words, he puts the flour sack over his
head. He tussles with the sack for a bit, then from inside the sack;

SPENCER BENNETT
Damn, I can't see fuckin' shit outta
this thing.
He sticks his fingers in the.eye holes, and rips, trying to make the
holes bigger, he only succeeds in making-visibility more obscured.

BRADSHAW
We ready, or what?









3 7

SPENCER BENNETT
Hold on I'm fuckin' with my eye holes.

(RIPS)
Shit ...I just made it worse.
He rips. it off his head in frustration.

RANDY
I can't see shit either.

REDFISH
Who made this goddamn shit?

0. B.
Willards wife.

WILLARD
Well make you own goddamn masks!

SPENCER

(TO WILLARD)
Look nobody's saying they don't appreciate
what Jenny did.

REDFISH
Well if all I hadda do was cut a bag, I
could cut it better then this.

0. B.
How 'bout-you Robert, can you see?

ROBERT
Not too good. I mean if I.don't move my head,
I can see you pretty good ... . more or less.
But when I start ridin' the bag starts moving
all over, and I'm riding blind.
Randy tears at his bag.

RANDY
Oh shit, I just made mine worse.
He puts it on-then says;

RANDY
Yep, it's worse.
He yanks it off his head.

RANDY
Did anybody bring any extra bags?

TERRY
No, no one brought a extra bag!









3 9

RANDY
I'm just asking.

DOUG
Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?

SPENCER
Shitfire, if you don't wear 'em as you ride
up, that just defeats the purpose.
Redfish, fatter then some (but not all), takes off his bag.

REDFISH
I can't see in this fucking thing!
I can't breathe in this fucking thing!
And I can't ride in this fucking thing!

WILLARD
Fuck all y'all! I'm going home. I watched
my wife work all day gettin' thirty bags
ready for you ungrateful sonsabitches!
And all I hear is criticize, criticize, criticize.
From now on don't ask me or mine for nothin'!
Willard rides off.
O.B. removes his bag, and yells after Willard.

SPENCER
O.B., I tole yo to keep quiet! They're asleep,
not dead.

O.B.
But Willards riding off.

SPENCER
Fuck Willard! Look, let's not forget why we're
here. We gotta killer nigger over that hill.
And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.

RANDY
Okay, I'm confused, are the bags on or off?
Robert takes off his bag, and says;

ROBERT
I think we all think the bags was a nice
idea. But, not pointing any fingers, they
could of been done better. So how 'bout,
no bags this time, but next time, we do the
bags right, and then we go full regalia.
Everyone takes off their bag.

SPENCER
Wait a minute, I didn't say no bags!









YO

TERRY
But nobody can see.

SPENCER
So?

TERRY
So, it would be nice to see.

SPENCER
Goddamit, this is a raid! I can't see, you
can't see, so what? All that matters is can
the fuckin horse see! That's a raid.
Spencer puts on his sack, everyone else, reluctantly, does as well.

EXT - LAKE - NIGHT
The THIRTY RIDERS, all with SACKS OVER THEIR HEADS, come riding over
the hill, hooting and hollerin. Since nobody can see they ride
haphazard into each other.'Redfish falls off his horse hard on his fat
ass. They surround the camp, and when the sleeping Schultz and Django
don't react, they know something's up. But since nobody can see,
everybody and everybody's horse is. confused.

WE HEAR A GROUP OF LINES FROM CIRCLING COWBOYS ON HORSEBACK WITH BAGS
OVER THEIR HEADS: "Where are they, I can't see" - "They tricked us" -
"Did somebody fall" "Where the hell are they" "Y'all, Redfish fell
off his horse-He's kinda hurt bad."
Then amongst the confusion...

WE SNAP ZOOM TO

A BIG TREE
on the other side of the lake
Then quickly cut into The Tree.
Till we're in a CU OF Dr.SCHULTZ
with a SCOPE SIGHT RIFLE up to his eye.

SCOPE SIGHT POV
The Yellow covered STICKS OF DYNAMITE protruding from the ground, are
inside the scope sight circle, Horse hooves step around it.

TWO SHOT
Dr.SCHtJLTZ and DJANGO up in a tree.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Auf wiedersehen.









L,
He fires.
The Camp EXPLODES Blowing Horses and Riders Apart.
Dr.Schultz and Django lift up repeating rifles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Let 'em have it!

DJANGO
I can't see nothin'.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Just fire into the smoke.
The two treetop killers let loose with rifle fire.

INSIDE OF THE SMOKE
pandemonium reigns. Horses and Men trip over bodies and pieces of
bodies, of horses and men. Men with legs and arms blown off, yell
bloody murder, hurt and scared Horses cry. Some struggle to get the
sacks off their heads, while scared horses dance and buck in panic.
Some are shot by the rifle fire. The rest of the men not blown up, and
still on horseback, between the sacks and the smoke, still can't see
worth a damn. And Men and Horses collide with one another, which causes
more bucking and riders falling. About fifteen of the men who can still
ride, high tail it the fuck out of there. Whipped and whimpering like
dogs.

SPENCER BENNETT
on his horse with the other fleeing regulators RIDES for his life...

SCOPE SIGHT POV
We see the back of the fleeing Bennett smack dab in the cross hairs.

DJANGO
scope sight rifle up to his eye.
Schultz next to him, says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
He's getting away.

DJANGO
I got 'em.

SPENCER'S HORSE
his hooves race and rip up the grass.

SPENCER
riding for his life...

DJANGO
scope sight rifle up to his eye.








Dr.SCHULTZ
He's getting out of range.

DJANGO
I got 'em.
INSERT: A black finger squeezes the rifle trigger.

SPENCER BENNETT
we're behind him as he rides away, OFF SCREEN we hear the whistling of
what sounds like an incoming missle.

SPENCER BENNETT
we're in.front of Spencer Bennett as he rides, when Django's bullet,
RIPS THROUGH his CHEST.

DJANGO

DJANGO
I got 'em.

SPENCER BENNETT
falls from his horse, dead.

DJANGO
scope sight rifle in his hand, big smile on his face, looks.to
Dr.Schultz.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Like that, huh?
Referring to the scope sight rifle;

DJANGO
I like.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, I think while they take this opportunity
to lick their wounds, we should take this
opportunity to get the fuck out of Tennessee.
They hop out of the tree.

MONTAGE
Dr.Schultz in a big city, buying Django a new saddle. Django gets his
first initial "D" etched into it. The men go to different stores to
purchase Django's wardrobe. The outfit bought, is selected by Django,
with suggestions offered by Schultz. When he's done, Django looks damn
handsome in his new duds. Brown cowboy boots, Green Corduroy Jacket,
Smokey Grey Shirt, Tan Skin Tight Pants, and Light Brown Cowboy Hat.
He looks a. bit like Elvis in "Flaming Star" and a Little Joe Cartwright
on "Bonanza". However, tellingly, he keeps Ace Speck's Winter Coat as
his winter coat.









EXT - COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
Django, sitting on his new saddle, in his new duds, rides alongside
the good doctor Schultz. The German carries a PICNIC BASKET.
Dr.SCHULTZ
But I'm serious son, Greenville is just too
dangerous for you to go fucking around there.
You're a freed, slave, you should be in New York.
You shouldn't be in Greenville, you shouldn't
even be forty miles on any side of Greenville.,
You shouldn't be anywhere in Mississippi.

DJANGO
She's my wife, it's my job to look after her.
If Greenville's where I gotta go to find out
where she went, then I gotta go. Now you
were sayin' where I gotta go first?
Dr.SCHULTZ
There'should be some sort of records office.
You know when she was sold, you know where
she came from, the Carrucan Plantation, and
you know her name ... . what is her name?

DJANGO
Broomhilda.
Schultz reacts.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Broomhilda?
Django.nods his head yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Were her owners German?
Now Django reacts, "How did he know that?

DJANGO
Yeah, how did you know? She wasn't born on
The Carrucan Plantation. She was raised by
a German mistress, The Von Shafts. She can
speak a little German too.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Your wife?

DJANGO
Yeah, when she was little her mistress taught
her so she'd have somebody to talk German with.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So let me get this straight, your slave
wife speaks German, and her name is
Broomhilda Von Shaft...?









DJANGO
Yep. Mouthful, huh?
Dr.SCHULTZ
To say the least.
(stopping the horse)
This looks like a very pretty place to have
our picnic. What'd ya say, here?

TIME CUT

EXT - PICNIC IN COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
The two men sit on a blanket with a nice picnic spread spread out.
Django eats a cucumber sandwich with the crust cut off, and drinks a
cup of tea.

DJANGO
How did you know Broomhilda's first masters
were German?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Broomhilda is a German name. If they named
her, it stands to reason they'd be German.

DJANGO
Lotsa gals where you from named Broomhilda?
Dr.SCHULTZ
No, not so much. Broomhilda is the name of
a character in one of the most popular of
all the German legends.

DJANGO
Really? There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes there is.

DJANGO
Do you know it?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Every German knows that story. Would you
like me to tell you?
Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well Broomhilda was a princess. She was the
daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods.
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

DJANGO
What she do.?








Dr.SCHULTZ
I don't exactly remember. I think she disobeys
him in some way. So at first he's just going to
obliterate her -

DJANGO
Obliterate... . what does that mean?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Like blow up.
He pantomimes a explosion.

DJANGO
Phew, that's pretty mad.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes it is, and like most fathers, given a
little time, he calms down a bit. He's
still mad at her. He still wants to punish her.
Just not ... . blow her up. So instead what he
does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain.

DJANGO
Broomhilda's on a mountain?
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's a German legend, there's always going
to be a mountain in there somewhere. So, he
puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a
fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
And. then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire.
And there Broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero
arises brave enough to save her.

DJANGO
Does a fella arise?
From now on as Dr.Schultz talks, he's beginning to realize something he
wasn't aware of when the conversation started.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes Django, as a matter he does. A fella
named, Sigfried.

DJANGO
Does Sigfried save her?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes he does, and quite spectacularly, so.
Now true, he is assisted in his triumph by
a truly, truly, remarkable sword, still, having
said that, Sigfried triumphs over all of his
obstacles not just due to his sword, but due to
his courage. He scales the mountain, because he's
not afraid of it. He defeats the dragon, because
he's not afraid.of him.








Dr.SCHULTZ (CON'T)
He walks through hellfire because
Broomhilda's worth. it.
After that last line of dialogue... .the two men just let a moment pass
as they nibble on their sandwiches.

DJANGO
I know how he feels.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I think I'm just starting to realize that.
He pours Django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot, as he
thinks about what he's going to say next.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Look Django, I don't doubt one day you will
save your lady love. But I'm afraid I can't
let you go to Greenville in a good conscious.
Let me ask you a question, how do you like
the bounty hunting business?

DJANGO
Kill white folks, and they pay ya?
What's not to like?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I hafta admit, we make a good team.

DJANGO
But I'thought you were mad at me for killin'
Big John and Rodger?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, on that occasion, you were a tad
overzealous. But normally, that's a good
thing. How'd you like to partner up for
the winter?

DJANGO
What'd ya mean partner up?
Dr.SCHULTZ
You be my deputy, for real this time. A lot
of the big money is in outlaw gangs. Some
of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or
three thousand a piece. With one man, anything
over three men is a risk. But with a partner?
Creating cross fire? It's fish in a. barrel.
A lot of these gangs hold up in the'hills
for the winter.

DJANGO
You makin' another agreement?









W7
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes. You work with me through the winter,
till the snow melts. I give you a third
of my bounties. And while we're together,
I'll teach you a few things you're going
to need to know.

DJANGO
Can you teach me how to make Tony do that
head bow thing that Fritz can do?
Dr.SCHULTZ
That among other things. We make some
money this winter, when the snow melts,
I'll take you to Greenville myself, and
we'll find where they sent your wife.
I'm pretty good at finding people. Is it a deal?
No white man has ever done anything for Django, just to him. So
understandably, he's a little suspicious.

DJANGO
Why you care what happens to me? Why you
care if I find my wife?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well frankly, I've never given anybody
their freedom before. And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you. You're
just not ready to go off on your own, it's
that simple. You're too green, you'll get hurt.
Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried,.
it's kind of a big deal. As a German, I'm
obliged to help you on your quest to
rescue your beloved Broomhilda.
Django accepts that response.
What follows is a MONTAGE covering the five months that Django and
Schultz partner up as bounty hunters. Schultz wears his normal
ensemble. Django wears his cool looking Green Jacket, unless it's
really cold, which a lot of this Montage is. Then he still wears Ace
Specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes.

WE SEE
A SCENE to be improvised (more or less), where Dr.Schultz teaches
Django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his hip.
By the end of the scene, after trial and error, we see Django's going
to be good at this.

EXT - HILLSIDE - SUNNY DAY
We see Django and Dr.Schultz walking up a hill. Tony and Fritz have
been left tied up downhill. Django leads a extra body HORSE (named
PONCHO) behind him. Dr.Schultz carries his scope sight rifle in 'a long
case. They get to the top of the hill. It overlooks a small farmhouse.









Y, 8

DOWN BELOW WE SEE
A LITTLE MAN struggling behind a plow, and his FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SON
helping him by leading the horse forward.
On top of their perch on the hill top, Dr.Schultz says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Keep down or he'll see you.

DJANGO
Who that farmer? Who cares?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well since we came here to kill 'em, he
just might.

DJANGO
What? The little man pushin' that plow?
Dr.SCHULTZ
That little man pushing that plow, is Smitty Bacall.

DJANGO
Smitty Bacall is a farmer?
Dr.SCHULTZ
No. Smitty Bacall is a stagecoach robber
who's hiding out as a farmer, because
there's a seven thousand dollar bounty on
his head.
He hands Django the scope rifle case.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And he's all yours my boy.
DJANGO lays on his belly, with the Scope Sight up to his eye.

SCOPE SIGHT POV:
on the Farmer struggling behind his plow, working hard with his horse
and his son.
Django's finger on the trigger... .but he hesitates.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh what happened.to mister I wanna kill white
folks for money?

DJANGO
His son's with him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good. He'll have a loved one with him.
Maybe even share a last word. That's
better then most get, and a damn. sight
better then he deserves.









1Ï¿½9
Django still hesitates.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Put down the rifle. Don't worry, I'm not
mad at you. Take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
Django removes the folded up handbill from the pocket of his tan pants.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Read it aloud. Consider it today's lesson.

DJANGO

(READING)
"Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
The Smitty Bacall Gang. For murder and
stagecoach robbery. Seven thousand dollars
for Smitty Bacall. One thousand and five
hundred dollars for each of his gang members.
Known members of The Smitty Bacall Gang are as
follows, DANDY MICHAELS, GERALD NASH, and

CRAZY CRAIG KOONS."
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well done. Bravo. THAT is who Smitty Bacall
is. If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at
twenty-two, they would never of printed that.

(REFERRING TO

THE HANDBILL)
But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches,
and he didn't mind killing people to do it.
You want to save your wife by doing what
I do? This is what I do. I kill people,
and sell their corpses for cash. His corpse
is worth seven thousand dollars.
Now quit your pussyfootin and shoot him.
Django SHOOTS.
The Little Man down below behind the plow falls down.
The Young Boy doesn't know what happened at first. Then he figures'out
his father was just shot. He goes to him in the dirt.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You need to keep that Smitty Bacall handbill.

DJANGO
Why?
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's good luck. You always keep the
handbill of your first bounty.
They begin walking down the hill, to collect Smitty Bacall's body,
leading the extra body horse behind them.









50
As they walk down hill, they watch the little scene of Smitty Bacall's
Son cradling his dying father.in his arms, the older man speaking his
last words to his son before he dies.
Dr.SCHULTZ
See, they're having a tender little father son
moment now. No doubt the most heartfelt one
they've ever had.

EXT - SNOWY FOREST - NIGHT
It's now full on snowy winter in the hills.
Django practices his quick draw against a SNOWMAN he's built. He sticks
a BOTTLE in it, so the bottom of the bottle is where the snowman's
heart would be.
He DRAWS...
Shoots the bottle heart!
He DRAWS ...
Shoots the left coal eye.
He DRAWS ...
Shoots the right coal eye.
He DRAWS...
Shoots the carrot nose.
Dr.Schultz comes up behind him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I think it's safe to say you're faster then
the snowman.

EXT - SNOWY FOREST - DIFFERENT NIGHT
A outlaw gang known as The WILSON - LOWE GANG (five guys) ride through
a snowy forest at night. When all five men and their Horses, are SHOT

FROM ABOVE.

DJANGO AND SCHULTZ
up in a tree, FIRING DOWN ON them.

EXT - WINTER MOUNTAIN TOWN MAIN STREET - NIGHT
The FLAKES continue to FALL HARD as Dr.Schultz and Django ride down
the main street of town, pulling poor Poncho who's FULLY LOADED DOWN
with five corpses.









571
The local SHERIFF, DON GUS, watches the two men ride up, he knows them.

SHERIFF GUS
Doctor and Django, how the hell are ya,
and who the hell ya got there?
Dr.SCHULTZ
The Wilson - Lowe Gang.

SHERIFF GUS
Who the hell's The Wilson - Lowe Gang?
Dr.Schultz removes a handbill from his inside jacket pocket, and hands
it down to the friendly peace officer.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Bad Chuck Wilson, and meaner Bobby Lowe.
And three of their acolytes.

SHERIFF GUS
Just leave 'em out here, they ain't going
nowhere. And if'in they do, god must love
'em, so who are we to say. Come outta the
snowy snow and git yourself some coffee.

TNT - SHERIFF GUS'S OFFICE - NIGHT
The snow encrusted bounty hunters come inside the lawmans office.
They exchange pleasantries about the weather as the Sheriff pours them
coffee. After the two frosty gentlemen have drunk some of the hot
liquid, they get down to business. As Schultz and Gus discuss the
bounties, Django reads the handbills aloud from off the wall. On the
third one he reads, WARREN VANDERS, and a two thousand dollar bounty,
"That one", Schultz says.
Django RIPS IT off the wall.
As the winter has progressed, we see they've become a genuine bounty
hunting team. And Django, a genuine bounty hunter.

EXT - PRETTY MEADOW - DAY
The snow has melted, and it's SPRING. And inside of this meadow Django
practices his fast draw against five men...
.by Schultz throwing FIVE COINS in the air ...
DJANGO DRAWS FAST shoots three coins, FIRES again hitting another, then
falls to the ground to get the fifth.
He looks up from the ground at Schultz.









5L
As Schultz collects the coins off the ground, he says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You're pretty confident aren't you?
Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You have reason to be.
He holds out his fist, opens his hand, the coins lay in his palm.
All the coins have bullet holes dead in their center. He drops them on
top of Django.

DJANGO
Still think I'm too green for Greenville?
Dr.Schultz removes a pipe, sticks it in his mouth and says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh you're ready for Greenville.
He lights a match, then lights the pipe, puffing as he says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Greenville ready for you, that I'm not so
sure.
He blows out the match...

WE GO TO BLACK
What we also saw in the above montage is Django shake off a lifetime of
slavery. Django, in his green jacket, in his cowboy hat, on top of his
steed Tony, with his gun hanging from his hip, has become his own man.
He's not a slave anymore. He's a bounty hunter.

CUT TO

EXT - THE TOWN OF GREENVILLE MISSISSIPPI - DAY
The whole Main Street of Greenville is thick with five inches of shit
brown mud that all the horse hooves, and wagon wheels, and slave feet
have to wade through to get from one end of the town to the other.









53
We see Django and Dr.Schultz enter the town, and slosh their horses in
the mud,, down the main street of Greenville Mississippi. The buying and
selling of slaves is what the whole town is built around.
BLACK MEN, WOMEN, and CHILDREN in BONDAGE are everywhere you look.
LINES OF CHAINED SLAVES being marched one way or the other, move
through the muddy streets of Greenville. WHITE MEN on horses move them
along.
BUCKBOARDS filled with DOMESTIC SLAVES (HOUSE NIGGERS), and pretty
PONYS, driven by WHITE MEN roll through the street.
A YOUNG WHITE BOY (14 years old), a shepherd, leads a bunch of
SLAVE CHILDREN through town. A SHEPHERD'S DOG, HELPS HIM OUT BY MOVING

THE KIDS ALONG.
Impromptu slave auctions take place on almost every block.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS on the bottom of the screen:

GREENVILLE

CHICKASAW COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI
Dr.Schultz takes in this African flesh market, where human beings sell
other human beings, with disgust and a little bit of shock.
Django is neither disgusted or. shocked, he knows first hand how
Greenville operates.
As he rides Tony through town in his snappy duds, he looks'at the BLACK
MEN half dressed: in chains. He REMEMBERS HIMSELF with his six Other
Companions from earlier, being walked through the mud of Main Street by
The Speck Brothers. On that day he might as well of been a steer.
Today, with a gun on his hip, money in his pocket, in his snappy
outfit, astride his steed Tony, he feels so different from these
wretched half naked bastards it gives him a bit of a chill.
Django sees the towns railroad depot, and across from it a huge SLAVE
PEN, like a STEER CORRAL. At the moment there's no train in the depot.

WE FLASH ON
The TRAIN, at a earlier time, pulling into the depot.

INSIDE ONE OF THE BOXCARS
amidst a boxcar full of shirtless BLACK MALES, Django watches the train
pull into the station, from inside the wooden slates of the boxcar.:
A hatch in the roof of the boxcar is NOISILY YANKED OPEN, and TWO WHITE
SLAVE TRADERS (RUSS AND JUDD), peer down at their human cargo.

JUDD
Good god almighty these niggers stink!









I F

RUSS
Niggers stink, where's the shock?
(to the Slaves

BELOW)
Okay you bucks, listen up, and listen
well, I'm only gonna say this once.
There's a slave corral right across from
this boxcar. We gittin ready to open these
doors. When we do, y'all run as fast as you
can, right into that pen. 'Anyone gittin off
trail, gonna get hurt and hurt bad. Now you
niggers better comprehend. And that goes for
any African garboons amongst y'all can't
understand english ... . your American buddies
better shove your ass in the right direction,
or your trip to this country is going to be
short, and pointless. Train to pen as fast as
you can!
The boxcar door is slid open, and a HUNDRED AND FIFTY BLACK MALES
run full out from the train to the steer corral.
We spot Django during the running.
Once inside the corral, the gate is closed.
COWBOYS with rifles act as prison guards.

INSIDE THE CORRAL
through the wooden posts, in the distance, Django watches them open up
the boxcar holding the females. They do their run to their pen out of
view.
Django catches a quick glimpse of Broomhild.a running with the other
LADIES, then she's gone from view.

BACK TO DJANGO (PRESENT)
Django and Dr.Schultz on top of their horses, taking in the sight of
Greenville.
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's a spectacle out of Dante.

DJANGO
You should see it from the other side.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Frankly, I don't know if I could endure this.

DJANGO
You'd be surprised what you can endure.

INT - RECORDS OFFICE - DAY
Dr.Schultz and Django walk into a records office, lined with books.
We watch through the store front window, the black man and white man
enter, and Dr.Schultz present his business card to a Dickensian looking
RECORDS OFFICE WORKER. As Schultz starts his spellbinding with words
routine... . The CAMERA FADES TO BLACK.

BLACK TITLE CARD:

BROOMHILDA

INT - SLAVE PEN - DAY
The same shot we saw before of Django fighting his way to the bars of
the slave pen, to get a better last look of Broomhilda.
Broomhilda, as before is walked by in the distance.
Then, as before Django loses sight of her.

EXT - MAIN STREET - GREENVILLE - DAY
We follow in front of Broomhilda being lead out of the slave pen by TWO
WHITE MALE SLAVERS. Her bare feet slosh in the Main Street mud, and
the leg irons scrap her ankles.
Up until now everything you've ever seen of Broomhilda, has only been
in Django's Spaghetti Western Flashbacks. In other words, from his
perspective, and memory. This is the,only time the story will shift to
Broomhilda's perspective. The strong but frightened girl is led out on
to the hustle and bustle, and wagon wheels and horse hoofs of Main
Street.
Broomhilda is not taken into that three story auction arena that Django
was sold in at the beginning. Instead She's just lifted up on a parked
buckboard wagon. Her SELLER (CLYDE) starts his pitch on the TWELVE or
so BUYERS that watch this puny make shift auction.

BROOMHILDA
looks down into the crowd of twelve ugly white men, and holds her
breath which one will buy her.
Among the ugly white men we see Mr.HARMONY (MIKE), not quite as ugly as
the rest. An older well dressed, classy gentleman. Next to him is his
twenty four year old overweight awkward son SCOTTY HARMONY.








Scotty in the audience, and Broomhilda on the wagon, THEIR EYES MEET,
he nudges his dad.
The Seller makes her expose her breasts to the small crowd. Then her
back, revealing her whip marks. Then pointing out the runaway "r"
branded in her cheek.
Some of the crowd, including Scotty, react with repulsion at the sight
of the whip marks. The Seller assures the crowd, that niggers don't
feel pain like white folks, and it only makes the women more gentle.

SELLER - CLYDE
Fellahs, you ain't felt gentle, till you felt
nigger gal gentle.

They look at each other as Mr.Harmony continues to bid.
A LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.









NARRATOR (VO)
On that day, eight months ago, the auction
was won by Mike Harmony, as a birthday present
for his fat boy son Scotty.
Mr.Harmony congratulates his son.
From on top of the buckboard Broomhilda looks down at her new owners.
Later they leave for the Harmony house. Scotty lifts Broomhilda up into
the back of the buckboard. He hands her a little white bag.

SCOTTY
This is for you.
She opens the bag,candies of many colors sit in it.

SCOTTY
They're jelly beans. Try one.
She selects a yellow one and puts it in her mouth.

SCOTTY
Good huh?
She nods her head, yes.
We see him drive the buckboard out of Greenville with Broomhilda in the
back eating her bag of jelly beans.

$XT - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
The buckboard makes its way down a country road. Broomhilda in the
back, and Scotty driving the wagon.
Scotty bought her, but he's too scared to talk to her.
Broomhilda's muddy bare feet dangle off the wagon. She's beginning to
realize the young master is the shy type.

BROOMHILDA
Master Scotty... ?

SCOTTY
Yes Broomhilda?

BROOMHILDA
I'm lonely back here. Can I come on up with
you on that seat so we can talk?

SCOTTY
Please, I'd love that.
She climbs into the driver's seat. In more ways then one.

EXT - THE HARMONY HOUSE - DAY
A nice two story southern house. Very nice, but hardly a plantation.
The household's FOUR DOMESTIC SLAVES. Broomhilda will be the fifth. The
buckboard pulls up to the front of the house.
Scotty's mother, Mrs.HARMONY (MARY LOUISE), waits to meet her son, and
his new bought nigger gal.
The older lady looks the black girl up and down and says to her;
Mrs.HARMONY
What's your name, gal?

BROOMHILDA
Broomhilda.
Mrs.HARMONY
Follow me. into the kitchen,
('to her son)
You stay out here.

INT - KITCHEN - DAY
Mrs.Harmony brings Broomhilda in her kitchen. The TWO DOMESTIC SLAVES
that were in, there are chased out by the boss lady. Mrs.Harmony grabs
Broomhilda by the wrist, and tells her;
Mrs.HARMONY
I want to have a word with you, wench. You met
my boy Scotty. You can tell ain't no white
girl gonna fool with him. And if they do fool
with him, they fool with him for the wrong
reason. Boy's twenty four, he still ain't a
man yet. That's why you're here. Be nice to him.
He's a very sweet boy. Play him right, he'll
eat bird seed out of your palm. Play 'em
wrong, you'll deal with me.

BROOMHILDA
I like Scotty. He's just shy is all. All he
needs is a little confidence.
Mrs.HARMONY
And you'll give that to him?

BROOMHILDA
I'll do my best, mam. Scotty's a real sweet boy.
Mrs.HARMONY
He is, isn't he?

BROOMHILDA
Ah-huh.
The mother lets go of the young lady's wrist.

Basically The Harmony's bought a slave
bride for young master Scotty that day.
And the two kids had a nice time playing
house for awhile.
We see Scotty and Broomhilda catching butterflies in butterfly nets in
the daytime..
At night they catch LIGHTNING BUGS together.
At night in Scotty's bed, while the young man lay fast asleep,
Broomhilda looks at her jelly jar of GLOWING LIGHTNING BUGS.

NARRATOR (VO)
As Scotty's sort of defacto sweetheart, if
no visitors were about, Broomhilda would
even join the family at their dinner table.
We see them at dinner eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes and
gravy.

And pretty soon she was adopted into a
member of the family.

NARRATOR (VO)
After three months of this bliss,
Scotty decided to take Broomhilda for
a romantic weekend in Greenville.

SCOTTY AND BROOMHILDA
drive through the Main Street of Greenville, dressed to the nines, in a
fancy carriage. Broomhilda dressed in a beautiful white lace dress,
complete with white lace gloves, fancy ladies hat, and white parasol.
Scotty, very proud of his pretty Pony, is dressed in a fashion best
described as plantation pimp daddy.









6O

NARRATOR (VO)
White masters would take their pretty
Ponys to Greenville for a treat or romantic
excursion, for two reasons-One, seeing
how bad the other slaves had it, always made
the papered Ponys appreciate their privilege
position, (just in case they'd forgot).

BROOMHILDA
holding her parasol, looking like a black Daisy Miller, watches the
OTHER SLAVES march by in the mud. They watch her too.

INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
Broomhilda and Scotty, and their luggage, move into the fancy hotel
lobby, and rent a room at the front desk.

INSERT: HOTEL REGISTRY
Scotty signs his name. The DESK CLERKS HAND checks the box on the
registry book that indicates darkee female companion.

INT -. GREENVILLE - NIGHT
Greenville at night is a little different. At night, RICH WHITE MASTERS
showing off their Ponys (like Scotty), rule the streets.

NARRATOR (VO)
And two, there was a sliver of society that
ran through Greenville at night that catered
to white masters who were infected with a
condition that was normally referred to as,
"Nigger love." At night the streets, the bars,
bistros, and buggy rides were ruled by rich
white masters showing off their pretty Pony's.

INT - THE CLEOPATRA CLUB - RESTAURANT - NIGHT
The interracial joint is jumping (as long as by interracial you mean
white men and black women).
Scotty and Broomhilda are enjoying a fancy dinner in the clubs dining
room.
We see across the dining room, the powerful white man, CALVIN CANDIE,
sitting with some White Men and some Black Ponys, eyeing Broomhilda.

SCOTTY
I gotta tell you Broomhilda -
I don't care if I go to. hell for this -
I love you. And if loving you means I go to
hell ... . Well then hello Mr.Devil.
That was actually kind of funny. Broomhilda was right, all he needed
was a little confidence. She puts her hand on his.

NARRATOR (VO)
Then... speak of the devil and the devil
appears.

CALVIN CANDIE
appears at their table.

CALVIN CANDIE
Hello, my name is Calvin Candie, I own
The Cleopatra Club. And I would just like
to welcome an attractive couple'like
yourselves to my favorite place on earth.
Scotty stands up and shakes hands with Calvin.

SCOTTY
Thank you so much, it's a great honor.
We love it here.
Pointing at a empty chair.

CALVIN CANDIE
May I join you?-

SCOTTY
Please, by all means.
Calvin sits down.
Broomhilda gets a sinister chill from this smiling jack.
Scotty, as per usual, is clueless.

CALVIN CANDIE
How long have you been a member?









SCOTTY
We just joined this weekend.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well our little private oasis appreciates
your patronage. Some may consider the dues
excessive, but they're necessary for us to
create this haven for the alternative
lifestyle we've all become accustomed to.

SCOTTY
Well said, and money well spent.
He squeezes Broomhilda's hand.
Candie sees this.

CALVIN CANDIE
It would be.my pleasure, your first
weekend at the club, to join me and my
friends at my table.
Broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided.
But Scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like Calvin Candie.
She tries to imply they should stay where they are. He brushes her off
with a, "Don't be silly."
We see Calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple, and they
join the party.
Calvin Candie has his arm around a foxy Pony named SHEBA, whose dress
is a little more revealing then the others.
They drink and talk, and the White Men have a forced good time. But
Calvin Candie can't hide his sinister side from Broomhilda, and it
keeps her uncomfortable, until she excuses herself from the table to go
to bed. Scotty's having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts
to stay behind.'Broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff, due to Scotty's
disobedience. If these fancy.fucking white men weren't around making
Scotty feel so puffy chested, he'd never dismiss her that way.
We FOLLOW Broomhilda out of the club, across the street, to the hotel.

NARRATOR (VO)
After excusing herself, she walked across
the street to her hotel room. She got
her white dress dirty in the mud, but she
didn't care, the night was ruined anyway.
Some romantic weekend. Wait till she gets
home and tells his mother how he ignored her.
She'll fix his fat ass. Wait till he asks her
to scratch his back next time. She's gonna
scrape every pimple.

ï¿½-. BACK AT THE CLEO CLUB
The now drunk Scotty is playing poker with Calvin and his friends.

NARRATOR (VO)
Back at The Cleopatra Club, as the night
wore on, Calvin Candie suggested'a friendly
card game. As the game wore on, it came down
to a two thousand dollar pot between
Calvin Candie and Scotty Harmony. Luckily
for him, Scotty was holding.a inside straight.
Calvin holds his cards with Sheba draped around him. She whispers
something in his ear.

CANDIE

(TO SHEBA)
Really?

(TO SCOTTY)
You know what Sheba just tole me?
Scotty, thinking about his great hand, says;

SCOTTY
What?

CANDIE
She says she thinks you're cute.

SCOTTY
Really? Thank you Sheba, I think you're
beautiful.
Sheba whispers something else in Candie's ear.

CANDIE
Sheba says she'd like to give you a little
lip. Want some lip?
Scotty, is a little surprised.

SCOTTY
Well, she's your Pony...I mean...

CANDIE
Oh hush, what's a little nigger lip 'tween
friends. Go on honey, give 'em some sugar.
Sheba walks over to Scotty's side of the table, and gives him a very lip
intensive'soul kiss. The table enjoys the show. Then Sheba goes back to
Calvin's side of the table.
The game continues.









G

CANDIE
Okay loverboy, I think you're trying to out
brazen me in my own club, and I won't have
it. If you're really holding cards, time to
pony up. I raise you five hundred.
Candie throws in his chips.

SCOTTY.
I see your five hundred...
(throws in chips)
.and raise you four hundred more.
(tosses his last chips)
Call.
This is where Calvin Candie has waited to be all night.

CALVIN CANDIE
Not so fast, boy.

(BEAT)
Pot ain't fat enough yet.

SCOTTY
I'm all in.

CALVIN CANDIE
Ain't that too bad.
Scotty doesn't intend to let this smiling Jack cheat him out of his
pot, especially with him holding an inside straight.

SCOTTY
I would think a southern gentleman of
such renown as yourself, wouldn't have
to resort to buying a pot in his own club.
Calvin writes on a piece of paper, then throwsit'in the pot.

CALVIN CANDIE
One final raise.
Scotty takes the piece of paper, "What's this?"

CALVIN CANDIE
It's Sheba's bill of sale.

SCOTTY
What? I don't want her.
Calvin.and the whole table laugh at that.

CALVIN CANDIE
You sure didn't look like you didn't want her.
More laughter.









CALVIN CANDIE
In Greenville slaves are currency. And
Sheba's worth about eight hundred dollars.
I'm throwing Sheba in the pot. Match or
fold?

SCOTTY
I'm all out of money.

CALVIN CANDIE
But we ain't playin' for money no more..
We matchin' nigger gals. And a nigger gal
you got.

SCOTTY
I can't bet Broomhilda.

CALVIN CANDIE
In Chickasaw County, she's money. Pony her up
or fold. Somebody get him a piece of paper
and a pencil.
Somebody does.

CALVIN CANDIE
Write out a bill of sale, or fold them cards.
Scotty makes a pressured decision.
He hurriedly takes the pencil and writes out a Bill of Sale for
Broomhilda.

SCOTTY
Let me see your cards!
Candie lays down his cards, he has a FLUSH.
What Scotty's just done hits him like a ton of bricks.

SCOTTY
You cheated me.
After Scotty uses the "C" word, everybody quiets down.

CALVIN CANDIE
What did you just call me?

SCOTTY
I called you a card cheatin' son of a bitch,
cause that's what you are!
Calvin calmly stands up from the table. He removes a small Derringer
Gun.from his pocket, and tosses it on the table in front of Scotty.
Then takes out another one, and tosses it on the table in front
himself .









66
Everybody in The Cleo Club quiets down.

CALVIN CANDIE
Scott Harmony. For calling me a card cheat
in my own club, as a southern gentleman,
I challenge you to a duel.
(to the Piano

PLAYER)
Piano player, will you hit three separate
notes?

(TO SCOTTY)
On the third note, pick up the gun and
try to kill me.
(to Piano player)
Piano player please ...
This is all going too fast for slow Scotty.

SCOTTY
Wait a minute ...no!

FIRST NOTE ...

SCOTTY
I ain't dueling with you! I don't want
to duel!

CALVIN CANDIE
Then get out of here, get in your buggy
and get out of town.

SCOTTY
Sure. Let me just get my girl.

CALVIN CANDIE
You lost that girl, fat boy.

SECOND NOTE...

SCOTTY
Wait!... . Look ... . Mr.Candie, I'm sorry I
called you a cheat. But... please...I can't
give you Broomhilda.

CALVIN CANDIE
Last chance fat boy, go home and get'useta
to fuckin' another one.

(BEAT)
Or pick up that gun.
Scotty can't leave. He can't go home without her. He can't face his
parents. He can't walk out on her. No matters what happens he can't
leave.

INT - GREENVILLE SLAVE AUCTION - DAY
Back inside the three story Auction Block domed room.
The same room Django was sold in at the beginning.
Tons of WHITE BUYERS and SELLERS and BLACK SLAVES to be bought or sold
fill the big hall.

ONE MANDINGO SLAVE (BANJO)
stands half naked on the auction block.
The SELLER' (SHELBY)
gives the crowd,a sales pitch about Banjo, and starts the bidding.
Many different UGLY WHITE MEN make bids on the big mandingo, including
Calvin Candie.
Dr.SCHULTZ and DJANGO from a pair of OPERA GLASSES
/-. watch Calvin Candie from up above on the 2nd floor landing.
FROM Dr.SCHULTZ'S PERSPECTIVE
We see Calvin Candie, and his black slave.bodyguard, BARTHOLOMEW,
always dressed in a slightly ill fitting three piece suit and bowler
hat, among the crowd of buyers at the auction block below.
Candie's lawyer LEONIDE MOGUY joins him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Calvin Candle, and he is the
owner of Candyland.

DJANGO
Candyland? The mandingo fightin' place?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, so you heard of it?

DJANGO
Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well apparently, that's where your wife is,

Dr.SCHULTZ
How much do you know about mandingo fighting?

DJANGO
Not so much... A little... Master Carrucan had
a couple niggers he'd fight.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Can you play a mandingo expert?

DJANGO
What?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Can you convincingly masquerade as someone
who is an expert on mandingo fighters?

DJANGOÂ€¢
Why?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Because when a man has one of the four
biggest cotton plantations in Dixie, but
the only thing that seems to ring his chimes
is big sweaty black males, if WE want to get
his attention, we better be talking about
big sweaty black males. So my character is
that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here
in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo
fight game. And your character is the mandingo
expert I hired to help me do it.

DJANGO
They call that "One-Eyed Charly."
Dr.SCHULTZ.
One-Eyed Charly?

DJANGO
That's what you call it when you buy a slave
expert. If you wanna raise horses, but don't
know nothin' 'about horses, you buy yourself
a One-Eyed Charly who knows about horses.
He teaches ya. You wanna plant tobacco but
don't know nothin' about it, you buy yourself
a One-Eyed Charly knows about tobacco.
Dr'. SCHULTZ
Why do they call it One-Eyed Charly?









70

DJANGO
You know, back on the plantation, my. job
wasn't historian.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Testy. It's an unusual name. That's a perfectly
legitimate question. So, can you convincingly
play my mandingo One-Eyed Charly? Don't say,
yes, if you can't.

DJANGO
You want me to play a black slaver? There
ain't nothin lower then a black slaver. Black
slavers are lower then head house niggers, and
buddy, that's pretty fuckin low.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Then play him that way! Give me your black slaver.
Django gets that.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Can you do that?

DJANGO
That, I can do. What's next?
Dr.SCHULTZ
To get ourselves personally invited to
Candyland by Calvin Candie himself.

CUT TO

EXT - THE CLEOPATRA CLUB - NIGHT
Dr.SCHULTZ and DJANGO stand across the street from The Cleopatra Club.
Which looks like aregular nice three story house, among other.nice
houses on an affluent residential block in Greenville Mississippi.
They open the tiny garden gate in front of the house, walk up the stoop
steps to the front door. They ring the doorbell.
A pretty young black girl, dressed in a FRENCH MAID outfit opens the
door.

FRENCH MAID

(SOUTHERN ACCENT)
Bonjour.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(AMUSED)
Bonjour, mon petite femme noire.
We are here to see Calvin Candie.









7)
She's been taught to smile and say:

FRENCH MAID
Enter.
The two men walk into the entrance way of the house.
A beautiful mulatto HOSTESS greets the two men.

HOSTESS

(SPEAKING QUITE

REFINED)
Hello gentlemen, I'm Cleo, can I help you?
Dr.Schultz hands Cleo the guest card.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes I am Dr.King Schultz, and this is my
associate, Django Freeman.
Upon hearing Django is a free man her eyes go to, him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
We're here for a appointment with
Calvin Candie and Leo Moguy.

CLEO
Yes you gentlemen are expected. Please
make yourself comfortable. I'll inform
Monsieur Candie you've arrived.
(referring to the

FRENCH MAID)
Can Coco get either of you two gentlemen
a tasty refreshment?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Not at the moment.

CLEO
Then Coco will entertain you while I
inform Monsieur Candie.
Dr.SCHULTZ
How charming.
Cleo leaves.
Django wanders over the dining room, and peers inside.

INT - DINING ROOM (CLEOPATRA CLUB) - NIGHT
A lush fancy restaurant dining area inside of this house. The DINERS
are made up exclusively of well dressed WHITE MEN, and pretty BLACK
GIRLS (PONYS) dressed in the most elaborate ladies fashions of the day.









72
Some appear to be on dates.
Some appear to be enjoying a special evening (birthday, anniversary,
special treat).
- Some are.two men with two women.
Some are one man with two or three or more women.
The white men's ages range from early twenties to old men.
The girls ages ranges from their twenties, to thirteen.
The bill of fare is a combination of French cuisine, and hearty beef
driven American dining.
The dolled up, decked out'Ponys eat rich French cuisine complete with
elaborate sauces, and take their knives to thick cuts of steak.
The younger little girls, usually eat ice cream with hot fudge, banana
splits, and cookies.
While-all the men drink whiskey or wine, the girls all drink
sarsaparilla.
Dr.Schultz quietly moves next to Django and asks;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Have you ever seen anything like this
before?
Django shakes his head, no.

COCO CHIRPS;

COLO. -

(VERY COUNTRY)
Y'all gonna dine, it's real good. You
like catfish, we got good catfish. They use
alotta butta. You like sand dabs, we
got sand dabs.
LEO MOGUY descends from the clubs prominent staircase.

MOGUY
Dr.Schultz, good to see you again.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Moguy, thank you for your assistance
in creating the opportunity for this
appointment.
Mr.MOGUY
Nonsense, it's my job.

(CON'T)









73
Mr.MOGUY

(CON'T)

(LOOKING AT

DJANGO)
.So this'is the One-Eyed Charly I've heard
so much about.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, this is Django.. Django, this is Mr.Candie's
lawyer, Leonide'Moguy.

MOGUY
Just call me Leo. Calvin's in the billiard
room, follow me. Y'all want Coco should come
along too?
Dr.SCHULTZ
We would be quite lucky indeed if the
charming Coco cared.to follow.
Coco blushes.

MOGUY
You better watch out doctor, you gonna
steal this little pony's heart.
They walk through the club to get to the billiard room, as they do they

SAY;
Dr.SCHULTZ
How long have you been associated with
Mr.Candie?

MOGUY
Calvin and I were about eleven when we
went to boarding school together. One
could almost say, I was raised to be
Calvin's lawyer.

DJANGO
One could almost say, you a nigger.
Coco can't believe what this snappy looking cowboy nigger just said to
Mr.Moguy.

MOGUY
What did you say?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh nothing, he's just being cheeky.
Anything else about Mr.Candie I should
know before I meet him?

MOGUY
Yes, he's a bit of a Francophile.









7EF
Dr.SCHULTZ
What civilized people aren't?

MOGUY
That's why all the French ambiance. And
he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mister Candie.
Dr.Schultz says in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
Dr.SCHULTZ

(FRENCH)
What ever he prefers.
This stops Moguy, and he turns to warn Schultz.

MOGUY
Oh he doesn't speak French. Don't speak
French to him, it'll embarrass him.
They get to the two sliding doors that lead to the billiard room.
Moguy slides the doors open...
The party enters the billiard room.

INT - BILLIARD ROOM (CLEOPATRA CLUB) - NIGHT
Inside is Calvin Candie, his bodyguard Bartholomew (still dressed in
the ill fitting suit), and the lanky sexy Sheba.
Also, at this moment, TWO MANDINGOS are having a bloody and savage
fight to death in this closed room.
An older European looking man, who's rooting for the mandingo that
Calvin's not rooting for, is also in the room. His name is.AMERIGO

VASSEPI.
Before any introductions can be made, with his back to the new arrivals
and his eyes on the black men fighting for their life, Calvin says;

CALVIN CANDIE
Why do you want to get in the mandingo
business?
That's quite abrupt and aggressive.
Dr.Schultz says, as if he's just been massively insulted;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You don't intend to allow your 2nd...
(referring to Moguy)
.to make the proper introductions?
Without turning towards them, Candie tells Schultz;









7S

CALVIN CANDIE
Quit stalling and answer the question.
The room is quiet.
Dr.SCHULTZ
The awful truth?

(PAUSE)
I'm bored, and it seems like a good
bit of fun.
Candie takes that to heart. He'll accept it for now.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well come on over, cause we gotta us a fight
goin on that's a good bit of fun_
Dr.Schultz steps up to get a better look at the savage fight.
The bigger mandingo is really hurting the smaller one.
Schultz has schooled Django on the importance of never BREAKING
CHARACTER.' Well now the good doctor must practice what he preaches.
Which means not only must he watch. the two men beat each other to
death, he must appear to convincingly enjoy it.

CALVIN CANDIE.
The bigger nigger is mine. I just bought
him today. What's his name, Moguy?

MOGUY
Big Fred.

CALVIN CANDIE
The other nigger belongs to this disreputable
Italian gentlemen to my right. Amerigo Vassepi.

(TO AMERIGO)
What's your nigger's name?

AMERIGO
Luigi... .?
Candie looks over at Django; who doesn't walk over to watch the fight.
Instead he walks over to a bar set up in the room. A slave bartender
named, ROSCOE tends it.

CALVIN CANDIE
How 'bout you, boy? You find nigger fightin'
a good bit of fun?

DJANGO
You seen one nigger fight, ya seen 'em all.

CALVIN CANDIE
How'd you two like to try the signature drink
of the club?









79
Dr.SCHULTZ
We'd love to.

CALVIN CANDIE
(yelling to the

BARTENDER)
Roscoe, two Polynesian Pearl Divers, and
don't spare the rum.
Roscoe makes the drinks in coconut shell glasses.
Big Fred kills Luigi.
Candie and his friends cheer.

CALVIN CANDIE
Arrivederci Luigi! Well, Mr.Vassepi, looks
like you owe me ten dollars.
Amerigo pays up the puny bet.
Django and Schultz get the fancy coconut shell drinks. They both take a
sip. Schultz hates it, Django loves it.
Candle turns his attention to Django.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's your name, boy?
Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Django.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
Where'd ya dig him up?
Dr.SCHULTZ
A fortuitous turn of events brought
Django and myself together.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO DJANGO)
I've heard tell about you. I heard you're a
real bright boy.

(BEAT)
I'm curious, what makes you such a
mandingo expert?

DJANGO
I'm curious, what makes you so curious?
Bartholomew puts down his pool cue, and turns toward Django;

BARTHOLOMEW
What you say, boy?









77
/ï¿½. Candie puts a calming hand on Bartholomew's shoulder.

CALVIN CANDIE
Calm down Bartholomew, gentle... gentle.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Monsieur Candie, I would appreciate it if
you directed your line of inquiry to me.

CALVIN CANDIE
Doc, I'm a seasoned slaver, you are a
neophyte. I'm simply trying to ascertain
if this cowboy is taking advantage of you.
Dr.SCHULTZ
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie, I
didn't seek you out for your advice. I
sought you out to purchase a fighting
nigger at above top dollar market price.
I was'under the impression when you
granted me an audience, it would be to
discuss business.

CALVIN CANDIE
No we weren't talking business yet. We
were discussing my curiosity.
Now according to Moguy here, if I do
business with you...

(POINTING TO

SCHULTZ)
, .I'm doin' business with both of y'all.

(POINTING TO

DJANGO)
He does the eyeballin', you the billfold?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well you don't make it sound too flattering,
but more or less, yes.
None of the white men in the room have any respect for a white man who
needs a nigger to tell him what time of day it is.
Candie turns his attention back to Django.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO DJANGO)
So Bright Boy,.Moguy here tells me you
looked over my African flesh, and were
none too impressed.

FLASH ON
we see. Django looking over THREE MANDINGOS..









BACK TO CLEO CLUB

DJANGO
Not for top dollar.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well then we got nothing more to talk
about. You wanna buy a beat ass nigger
from me, those are the beat ass niggers
I wanna sell.

DJANGO
He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna
sell. He wants the nigger you don't
wanna sell.

CALVIN CANDIE
I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna
sell.
Dr.Schultz chimes in thoughtfully;-
Dr.SCHULTZ
You won't sell your best. You won't even
sell your second best. But your third
best... .you don't want to.sell him... .But if
I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be
forced to consider it... . who knows what
could happen?

CALVIN CANDIE
What do you consider ridiculous?
Dr.SCHULTZ.
For a truly talented specimen,
."The Right Nigger"..:?
How much would you say, Django?

DJANGO
Twelve thousand dollars.
Calvin Candle takes in the figure.

CALVIN CANDIE
Gentlemen, you had my curiosity. Now
you got my attention.

TIME CUT

TNT -- CLEOPATRA CLUB -- RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Candle, Moguy, Django, Schultz, Bartholomew, Sheba, and Coco eat dinner
in the restaurant. All the men eat thick T-Bones. Coco eats Catfish.
And Sheba uses her fingers to rip apart Crawdads.









77

CALVIN CANDIE
How ya like that meat, Bright Boy?
Django's eyes go to Calvin, he nods his approval.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO COCO)
How's your Catfish, dew drop?

COCO
Real good Monsieur Candie.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
You spend a lot of time around niggers
aside from Freeman here?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Not so much.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well if'in you did,.you'd know what a
treat this was for 'em. You feel special
Coco?

COCO
Yes. sir, Monsieur Candie.

CALVIN CANDIE
You feel special Bartholomew?

BARTHOLOMEW
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
He looks to Sheba, who's licking her fingers from the Crawdads.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now Sheba always feels special. Dont'cha?

SHEBA
Yep.

CALVIN CANDIE
How 'bout you Bright Boy, you feel
special?

DJANGO

(MEANING SHEBA)
Not as special as her.
The table breaks out in laughter.









CALVIN CANDIE
Well we're leaving bright and early
tomorrow morning, and moving the. whole
kit and caboodle to "Candyland."
You oughta come with us.
Dr.Schultz and Django's eyes meet for a moment.. .so far...so good.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, that wasn't on the agenda. But I
suppose I could be amenable to that.
How far must we trek?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh hardly a ride at all, We'll still be
in Chickasaw County. Five hours.. .tops.
There you can get a look at my best
specimens. Have dinner with my sister
and I. Spend the night at Candyland as
my guest.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid.
Django and Schultz trade looks and small smiles.

WE CUT

EXT - COUNTRY SIDE MISSISSIPPI - DAY
It's the next day and a whole procession is making their way to
"Candyland."
Calvin Candie, Leonide Moguy, Dr.Schultz, Django, and THREE OVERSEERS
(BILLY CRASH, TOMMY GILES, and HOOT PETERS) ride horses.
Bartholomew (now dressed in work clothes) drives a buckboard filled
with'supplies.
FIVE MANDINGOS (Big Fred and Banjo who we already met, plus JOSHUA,
SIDNEY JAMES, and TATUM) recently purchased at the Greenville Auction
walk to their new home, with small bundles of their personal
possessions under their arm. They look like powerful warriors.

THREE OTHER SHIRTLESS MANDINGOS (RODNEY, CHICKEN CHARLY, CHESTER) WHO
WERE THE MANDINGOS FROM Candyland that didn't sell at Greenville are
walking back to Candyland, with their small bundle of personal
possessions under their arms. These poor devil's know their fate is
pretty dismal. Either they'll be sold to the LeQuint Dickey Mining
Company, or they'll be put in some mandingo fight they can't win, like
with Samson, or Stonesipher's dogs.









J

RODNEY
walks along the road, looks up at Django riding his horse. All the
slaves hate Django because they think he's a black slaver. But
the three heading back to Candyland are even more resentful.

FLASH ON
Django with Schultz, earlier, inspecting and rejecting these three.

RODNEY
gives Django a bad eyeball look up on his horse.

DJANGO ON TONY
sees it. He's playing the role of a fucker black slaver, he can't let
that shit stand.
He yells down to the powerless man;

DJANGO
Gotta problem with your eyeball, boy?
Rodney looks away.

RODNEY
No sir.

DJANGO
You want a boot heel in it?

RODNEY
No sir.

DJANGO
Then keep ya damn eyeballs off me!
Flash that bad look at me again,
I'll give ya reason not to like me!
As this parade makes progress, Django keeps his emotions in check, but
not without difficulty.
Dr.Schultz comes riding Fritz beside him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
How do you like this side of the slave
trade?

DJANGO
Not so much.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Prefer the other side?

DJANGO
I didn't say that.








Dr.SCHULTZ
I've confirmed Broomhilda's at Candyland.

DJANGO
Are you sure it's her?
Dr.SCHULTZ
He didn't call her by name, but she's a
young lady, whip marks on 'her back, and
speaks German. Now while it's not wise to
assume, in this instance, I think it's
pretty safe.

DJANGO
Did you offer to buy her?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I opened the door to my possible interest.
But naturally, sight unseen, I can only be
so interested.

SUDDENLY ...
Calvin Candie comes riding up behind them...

CALVIN CANDLE
Am I intruding?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Of course not.

CALVIN CANDIE

(APPRAISING THE

TWO MEN)
I swear you two are cozier then a couple
of cuttle fish.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You'd be surprised what a good
conversationalist Django is.

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh by now, I don't think that would
surprise meat all.
Candie gives Django a creepy smile.
Around now the audience may start noticing DOG BARKING in the distance.
Dr.SCHULTZ
When do we reach your property?









1?3

CALVIN CANDLE
You been on it. I own the whole sixty
miles 'fore we get to Candyland.
Candie gets annoyed at the barking dogs.

CALVIN CANDIE
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.

(YELLING BEHIND
him at Billy)
Billy Crash, git up here!
Billy Crash, a hillbilly overseer who's missing his two front teeth,
rides up.

BILLY CRASH
Yeah, Boss?

CALVIN CANDIE
Find out what that goddamn commotion
is up at the tracker shack!

BILLY CRASH
Right away, Boss.
Billy Crash TEARS UP AHEAD on his horse.

CALVIN CANDIE
You know, confidentially, just 'tween
us girls, worse things about this
business, ain't the slaves. It's all
the white trash ya gotta deal with.
Like these peckawoods we got riding with
us. These dumb, ignorant, sleazy sonsabitches
ain't good fer nuttin, except kickin' a
niggers ass can't kick back. Yeah, they
holdin' the pretty part of the whip, but
it's just a thin membrane separate 'em.
And don't think they don't know it either.
It's about the only thing these dumbass
motherfuckers do know. But ya need 'em.
Who the hell else ya gonna get to beat a
niggers ass, other than somebody might as
well be a nigger hisself. But these mountain
boys I use as trackers for the runaways,
they the worst. Nothin but a buncha goddamn
inbreed hillbillies. Now like that nigger
gal we was talkin' 'bout. I'm sure it.was
a pain in the ass, but with a lot of
patience, that German lady taught Hildi
how to speak German.
Django hears her name himself. His head does involuntary jerk, but his
ï¿½, emotions betray nothing.









PTE

CALVIN CANDIE

(CON'T)
Now these inbred hillbillies, on the other
hand, they can barely speak English. I can't
understand a damn word most of 'em say. You
could teach a plow horse how to make a pot
of coffee, 'fore you teach those fools how
to use a knife and fork. I tell ya, if it
wasn't for catchin' a nigger on the run,
they'd be as useless as tits on a boar hog.
Billy Crash comes riding back.

CALVIN CANDIE
What the hell's goin on?

BILLY CRASH
They got 'em a runaway.

CALVIN CANDIE
Who?

CUT TO

EXT - TRACKER SHACK - DAY
A BUNKHOUSE for the FOUR HILLBILLY TRACKERS (they track down runaway
slaves) that live here about forty miles from the Candyland Plantation.
A little dog kennel, looks like a chicken coup, sits next to the
bunkhouse.
The TRACKERS are a hairy, bearded, burly, buck skinned wearing, dirty
long haired lot.
Their Leader is Mr.,STONESIPHER, the other three are STEW, LEX, and
JAKE. The four men could be brothers, or cousins, or father and sons,
or just from the same hollow.
Lex holds two SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERDS on a leash. Stew one SNARLING
GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash. And Mr.Stonesipher holds one SNARLING
GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash, the lead dog, that goes by the name of

MARSHA.
A runaway slave named, D'ARTAGNAN, lies belly down in the dirt,
surrounded by the four vicious dogs, who BARK, GROWL, and SNAP at him.
One look at D'Artagnan tells you he's a mandingo who's been in one
fight too many. One of his eyes have been 'poked out. Big BITES have
been bit out of both his face and neck (by past fights, human bites,
not-the dogs), as well as three fingers have been bit off. Not to
mention he's covered in cuts, like he's been drug through a briar
patch.









O V5
The fourth Tracker, JAKE, doesn't engage in the melodrama. He hangs in
the background, CUTTING FIREWOOD with a big axe.
Calvin Candie, Dr.Schultz, Django, and the whole Candie caravan look
down on the runaway slave. Including the five new mandingos, and the three
old mandingos who know D'Artagnan.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well I'll be, D'Artagnan. Now boy, why do
a fool thing like run off?

D'ARTAGNAN
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh yes you can. You might not be able to
win, but your ass can fight. - Mr.Stonesipher,
shut these goddamn dogs up, I can't hear
myself think!
Mr.Stonesipher, yells to Marsha;
Mr.STONESIPHER
Hush now! Marsha! Marsha, hush up!
Marsha, Marsha, hush up!
(to the other

TRACKERS)
Take these goddamn dogs away from this nigger,
he's just makin' em hungry.
The other two YANK the dogs away from the fallen Black Man.

CALVIN CANDIE
How long was he loose?
Mr. Stonesipher spits tobacco juice.
Mr.STONESIPHER
A.night. Day. Half the other night.

CALVIN CANDIE
How far he git off property?
Mr.STONESIPHER
Bout twenty miles off prop. Pretty fer,
considering that limp he got.

CALVIN CANDIE
Moguy, who was D'Artagnan suppose to fight
Friday?.

MOGUY
(pointing behind him)
One of this new lot.









CALVIN CANDIE
Well the way he looks now a blind Indian
wouldn't bet 'a bead on 'em.

(TO D'ARTAGNAN)
Boy, you done made yourself as useless as
a tail on a teddy bear.
D'Artagnan starts begging.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now now, no beggin', no playin' on my
soft heart. You in trouble now, son.
Now you need to understand I'm runnin' a
business. Now I done paid five hundred
dollars for you. And when I pay five
hundred dollars, I expect to get five
fights outta a nigga 'fore he roll over
and play dead. You've fought three fights.

D'ARTAGNAN
I won every one.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well, yes you did. But that last one, you
muddied the line between winning and losing.
Calvin climbs down off of his horse, and walks to the captured runaway
on the ground.

CALVIN CANDIE
But the fact remains, I pay five hundred
dollars, I want five fights. So what
about my five hundred dollars? You gonna
reimburse me?
The Whites (except for Schultz) laugh.
This whole spectacle is making Dr.Schultz sick to his stomach.
Not Django ... . he's seen this little drama play out many times before.
The three returning mandingos, Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester,
watch their fellow doomed servant pay the price for running away.
The five new mandingos watch Calvin Candie's treatment of D'Artagnan to
know what to expect from their new home.
Bartholomew on the buckboard looks at the captured runaway like, poor
bastard.
Calvin prods further.

CALVIN CANDIE
You even know what reimburse means?









E 17
The Whites laugh.
Then SUDDENLY ...
.The German Speaks;
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'll reimburse you.
All eyes turn to Dr.Schultz.
Including Django's, whose eyes narrow at the doctor.
Calvin Candie uses the occasion to perform a slow dramatic turn in the
direction of the good German.

CALVIN CANDIE
You will?
Removing his long brown leather billfold from his suit jacket pocket.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes.

CALVIN CANDIE
You'll pay five hundred dollars for a
one eyed Ole'Joe, ain't fit to push a
broom?
Django's voice cuts through the Mississippi heat.

DJANGO
No he won't.
All eyes turn to Django.

DJANGO
He's just tired'of you toyin' with him is
all. And for that matter, so am I. But we
ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny,
we ain't got no use for 'em. Ain't that
right, Doc?
Dr.Schultz realizes he's just done the one thing he's always preached
to Django you can never do..BREAK CHARACTER. The doctor puts his
billfold back in his suit coat pocket.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO CANDIE)
You heard 'em.
The Hillbilly Trackers stare up at the black man on the horse in the
green jacket, slack jawed.
!` Even the one chopping wood in the BG stops his chopping.









CALVIN CANDIE
You'll hafta excuse Mr.Stonesipher's slack
jawed gaze. He ain't never seen a nigger
like you ever in his life..Ain't that right,
Mr. Stonesipher?
Mr.. Stonesipher., SPITS.
Mr.STONESIPHER
That's right.
Calvin steps up to Django on his horse. Looking up at the black man,
Calvin challenges Django to a staring contest.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well now since you won't pay a penny for
this pickaninny, you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger however I see fit?

DJANGO
He's your nigger.

CALVIN CANDIE
Mr.Ston.esipher... .let Marsha and her
bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
Mr.STONESIPHER
Marsha...git 'em!
The other Trackers let loose of the leashes holding the German
Shepherds back.
The DOGS CHARGE towards D'Artagnan on his knees...

THE MANDINGOS
all react to the sight of the dogs being let loose.
The DOGS ATTACK D'ARTAGNAN ...
As we HEAR the ATTACK ...
Candie.staring contest with Django...
Django, who expected nothing less and has seen worse, doesn't blink as
the runaway slave is torn to bits by canine teeth ...
The other Mandingos are scared sick at what they see.
The Hillbilly Trackers root the dogs on.
Dr.Schultz has never seen a man torn apart by dogs before, and he
appears not to enjoy it.
Calvin, without blinking, shifts his eyes toward Dr.Schultz, then back
ï¿½-. to Django.









P9

CALVIN CANDIE
Your boss looks a little green around
the gills for a blood sport like
nigger fightin'?
As D'Artagnan's SCREAMS and Marsha's GROWLS continue OFF SCREEN.

DJANGO
Naw, he just ain't use to seein' a man
ripped apart by dogs, is all.

CALVIN CANDIE
But you are use to it?

DJANGO
Well, him bein' German an' all, I'm
a little more use to American's then
he is. Now Monsieur Candie, whenever you're
ready, we rode five hours so you could
show off your stock. Let's git to it.
Cause as of now, if he's a example, I'
ain't impressed.
Calvin...BLINK...
Saying nothing, Monsieur Candie turns his back to Django, climbs up on
his horse, then looks at the black man.

CALVIN CANDIE
Follow me.
The whole caravan rides off as the dogs continue to tear D'Artagnan
apart.

EXT - THE GROUNDS OF CANDYLAND - DAY
The caravan starts to approach Candyland. Calvin Candie and his sister
own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of Mississippi.
As the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton, and fields of SLAVES
picking it.
The audience might of been expecting Candyland to be a hell on earth,
Auschwitz, Andersonville, Yuma Prison, a Mexican prison in a Sergio
Corbucci Spaghetti western ...
INSTEAD ... . CANDYLAND is very beautiful. The fields of cotton, the way
the trees hang green vines over everything. It's full of nature and
natures vibrant colors, and a broiling hot sun to see it all in.
One of the cottonpickers in the field, DOBIE, looks up, and sees Django
in his cool green corduroy jacket, badass cowboy hat, on top of Tony.
He taps the shoulder of another cotton picker (ORWELL), and points out
Django.









90
All of a sudden all the bent over backs in the field, straighten up to
get a better look at the black riding a horse.
Django looks back matching their stare.

EXT - SLAVE VILLAGE - DAY
The caravan rolls through the shack/cabin village the slaves live in.
As the parade rolls through all the SLAVES snap to attention, and bow
(very formally) as Monsieur Candie rides past. A KING among his SUBJECTS,
a PATRON with his PEONS, a FATHER amongst his CHILDREN, a SHEPHERD
among his SHEEP.
KIDS playing in the dirt get up and run to Calvin on his horse.
Candie calls the kids by name, takes out a bag of jelly beans, and
begins tossing them about.
The Kids scramble in the dirt for the bright colored candy.
This is Calvin Candie in his element, at his happiest.

THEN ...
.DJANGO rides by.
The CARAVAN moves from the slave village to the White Village the
overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds.
Other then the switch of white faces for black, it's pretty much the
same village.
And they too see Django ... . WOW!
The Caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the Plantation,
or The Big House as everyone calls it.
To the left of the Big House is big wooden ARENA built for his Friday
night nigger fights.
All the HOUSE SLAVES (the domestic slaves that work for the Candie
family in the Big House), and WHITE WORKERS (overseers and stray farm
hands) come out to greet the caravan.
They all greet Monsieur Calvin Candie, who naturally leads the
procession, as if he's Alexander The Great returning from the wars.
As the caravan comes to a stop in front of the Big House, it creates a
huge dust cloud behind it.
Calvin's widowed sister LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLY, an attractive
ï¿½. fortyish, strawberry blonde southern belle, steps out on the porch of
the Big House to greet her brother.








Directly above Lara Lee, on the third floor balcony over hang, out.
steps...

STEPHEN
eyeing Calvin and the approaching caravan.
Who's STEPHEN? Stephen is a very old black man, who with his bald pate,
and tufts of white curly hair on the sides, looks like a character out
of Dickens - if Dickens wrote about House Niggers in the Antebellum
South. -
Stephen has been Calvin's slave since he was a little boy. And in
(almost) every way is the 2nd most powerful person at Candyland.
Like the characters Basil Rathbone would play in swashbucklers, evil,
scheming, intriguing men, always trying to influence and manipulate power
for their own self interest. Well that describes Stephen to a tee.
The Basil Rathbone of House Niggers.
The old Man watches the caravan and the trailing dust cloud approach.

THEN...
Out of the dust cloud ...EMERGE DJANGO and SCHULTZ... . on TONY and FRITZ.
All the Candylanders see Django, dressed like he is, up on the horse,
and for a moment don't know what to think.
Lara Lee, like her brother, is both surprised and intrigued.
As Stephen peers down from his perch at the nigger in the green jacket,
it's hate at first sight. Stephen heads downstairs, he walks with a,
limp.
All the caravan riders are still up on their horses. Calvin sees
Stephen limping towards them, and greets him with a big how do you do;

CALVIN CANDIE
Hello Stephen my boy!

STEPHEN
Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass - who's
this nigger up on that nag?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh Stephen, why so ornery, you miss me?

STEPHEN
Yeah, I miss you like I miss.a rock in my
shoe. Like I said, who's this nigger, up
on that nag?

DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
Hey Snowball.








: Stephen looks up at Django on Tony.

DJANGO
If you wanna know who I am, or the name of
my horse, you ask me.

STEPHEN
Just'who the hell you callin' Snowball,
horse boy? I'll yank your ass of that
goddamn'nag, so goddamn fast - in the mud.

CALVIN CANDIE
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Stephen, let's keep it
funny. Django's a Freeman.
Stephen jerks a thumb up towards Django.

STEPHEN
This nigger, here?

CALVIN CANDIE
That nigger there. Let me at least introduce
the two of. you. Django, this is another
cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen.
Stephen, this is Django. You two should
hate each other.
Stephen uses'the special privilege he and he alone enjoys amongst the
blacks at Candyland.

STEPHEN
Calvin, who the hell is this nigger you
feel the need to entertain?

CALVIN CANDIE
Django and his friend in grey, Dr.Schultz
are customers, and they are our guests
Stephen. And you - you old decrepit bastard...
.are to show them every hospitality.
Do you understand that?

STEPHEN
I don't know why I gotta -

CALVIN CANDIE
You don't hafta know why, do you
understand?

STEPHEN
Yeah yeah yeah, I understand just fine.

CALVIN CANDIE
Good. They're spending the night. Go up
in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.









93

STEPHEN

(POINTING AT

DJANGO)
He's gonna stay in the Big House?

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different.

STEPHEN

(INCREDULOUS)
In the Big House?

CALVIN CANDIE
You gotta problem with that?

STEPHEN
I don't gotta problem, unless you gotta
problem with burin' the bed, the sheets,
and the pillow cases once this black ass
motherfuckers gone!

CALVIN CANDIE
That's my problem, they're mine to burn.
Your problem, right now, is making a
good impression. And I want you to start
solving that problem right now, and git
them rooms ready.
The Old Man looks up at his Master, and says;

STEPHEN
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
Stephen limps away to the guest rooms, muttering to'himself.
Lara Lee and her ever present shadow, a FAT MAMMY named CORA, comes up
to her brother on his horse.

CALVIN CANDIE
Dr.Schultz, this attractive southern belle
is my widowed sister, may I present to you,
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
Lara Lee does a southern lady bow.
Dr.Schultz lifts his bowler hat, and nods in a grand manner.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I am Dr.King Schultz, this is my 2nd
Django,
(Django tips his hat)
and these are our horses, Fritz and Tony.
Both Fritz and Tony do the head bow.








Dr.SCHULTZ
And it is our great delight to encounter
this flaming rose.

LARA LEE
Well aren't you the charming gentlemen.
You're not from around here, are you?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Actually I'm from a far off land,
Dusseldorf, to be exact.

CALVIN CANDIE
These two are in the market for a fightin'
nigger. So I thought I'd invite 'em down,
show 'em my stock.

LARA LEE
We'll all have dinner tonight, right?

CALVIN CANDIE
Half the reason I invited them. I thought
you'd find.them as intriguing as I do
little sister.
Lara Lee looks up at Django, and smiles.
All of a sudden THREE WHITE RIDERS ride up on horses, a older one, and
two tough looking younger ones. The'older one is the Cap't of the
Overseers, ACE WOODY, and his two assistants BROWN and JINGLE BELLS
CODY. While Ace is dressed for work on a farm, both Brown and Jingle
Bells Cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits.
As Calvin Candie watches the three riders approach, he turns to
Dr.Schultz and Django, and says;

CALVIN CANDIE
You know since I started fightin' niggers
about eleven years ago, it's been a new
lease on'life. And the man ridin' up here
now is the man responsible for all my
success.
Ace and his boys pull their horses up, kicking up dust.
Through the dust Ace, Brown, and Jingle Bells Cody eyeball Django and
Schultz.

CALVIN CANDIE
Howdy Ace.

(TO SCHULTZ

AND DJANGO)
This here is my Overseer .Cap't, and
nigger fight trainer extraordinaire,
Ace Woody.









915
Pointing at the two shadows that flank Ace Woody.

CALVIN CANDIE
And that's Brown and that's Jingle Bells
Cody.

(TO ACE)
Ace, this here is Dr.Ring Schultz, and
Django Freeman, they're big customers with
big pockets wanna buy a big nigger. So I
brought 'em out here so you could give
'em a little display of our African flesh.
Ace takes off his hat, bows from his horse, welcoming them.

ACE WOODY
Welcome to Candyland, gentlemen.
Astride their horses Brown and Jingle Bells Cody just make faces at
Django.
Ace's attention goes to the five new mandingos.just walked from
Greenville to here.

ACE WOODY
These the new chickens?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes siree bob.

ACE WOODY
How many you get?

(HE COUNTS)
One, two, three, four, five.

CALVIN CANDIE
Five real strong bucks.

ACE WOODY
How many you get rid of?

CALVIN CANDIE
We still got three left.
Ace looks to see who came back from the auction.
Leo Moguy chimes in;

MOGUY
I already wired the LeQuint Dickey people,
they'll be here tomorrow.
Ace turns to Brown.









ACE WOODY
Get 'em away from the others. Put 'em in
the pen till tomorrow.
Brown with his horse, yells, chases, and herds the three men away into
the slave pen.
Ace yells from his horse down to the five new mandingo arrivals, Big
Fred, Banjo, Sidney James, Tatum,.and Joshua.

ACE WOODY
Y'all stand over there and make a line!
They do.
Ace climbs down from off his horse.
Cody stays in his saddle, circling the black men with his horse.
Everybody, including Django and Dr.Schultz, watch the show.
Ace'Woody walks up and down the line looking at the new men.
Candie, sitting comfortably up on his horse, says;

CALVIN CANDIE
What do you think?

ACE WOODY
I think you lookin' for niggers to push
a plow, 'dem your boys.
Candie rolls his eyes.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's wrong with them?

ACE WOODY
Hold it...hold it, you done bought
r em, let me look at 'em.
Unimpressed Ace Woody continues to examine them.

ACE WOODY
Okay, how 'bout that one, did you
buy that one?

CALVIN CANDIE
Which one?

ACE WOODY
What you mean, which one? The one I'm
pointing at, that one.









77

CALVIN CANDIE
Actually, that one was purchased by
our mister Moguy.

ACE WOODY

(TO MOGUY)
You bought him?

MOGUY
Yes I did.

ACE WOODY
Why?

MOGUY
I like his prospects.

ACE WOODY
His prospects? Now you know Mr..Moguy,
I ain't a educated fella like yourself.
Remind me again what prospects means?

MOGUY
Hope for the future.
Jerking a thumb towards the slave in question.

ACE WOODY
You got hope for his future?

MOGUY
I did.

ACE WOODY
Well I don't.
Ace walks over to the slave in question.

ACE WOODY
What's your name, boy?
The mandingo says;

SIDNEY JAMES
Sidney James, sir.

ACE WOODY
So long Sidney James.
Ace takes the peacemaker out of the holster on his hip, and SHOOTS
Sidney James point blank in the belly.
Everybody reacts.








Especially the four other mandingos standing next to him.
Sidney James rolls in the dirt, screaming and holding his bleeding gut.
Till Cody puts a bullet in his head, putting him out of his misery.
Moguy, shakes his head, "Typical," he thinks.
Django and Schultz, on their horses next. to Candid, watch.
Ace looks up at his boss.

ACE WOODY
Boss Candie, which one did you buy?

CALVIN CANDIE
Well to me the pick of the litter is
Big Fred over there.

ACE WOODY

(POINTING AT

FRED)
This one over here?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes.

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
You Fred?
A very scared Fred answers.

BIG FRED
Yes, sir.

ACE WOODY
Well good to meet'cha Fred, I'm'Ace Woody,
I'm a man of influence 'round here. Now
Fred am I mistaken, or were you already in
a kurfuffle?

CALVIN CANDIE
I had 'em fight one of Amerigo's niggers
last night.

'ACE WOODY
How is of Amerigo?

CALVIN CANDIE
His nigger lost.









99

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
Really? You won?

BIG FRED
Yes, sir.

ACE WOODY
Wup'ed his ass?

CALVIN CANDIE
Beat 'em to death.
Smiling impressively at Big Fred.

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
Really?

CALVIN CANDIE
He did have fifteen pounds on 'em,
but still, he still beat his ass
to death.

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
You did?

BIG FRED)
Yes, sir.

ACE WOODY
Good job, boy. Got any more wins in ya?

BIG FRED
Yes, sir.
Ace gives Cody a slight head nod, and Cody SHOOTS Big Fred in the back.
Candie acts out mock frustration.
The remaining three mandingos jump a mile.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now why did you do that?

ACE WOODY
He won his last fight last night.
Ace puts his eyes on the three remaining mandingos









1 00

ACE WOODY

(TO MANDINGOS)
Those of you with exceptional ability
will find it ain't so bad here. Those of
you who don't possess exceptional ability,
will wish you did.
Ace looks up to Cody on his horse.

ACE WOODY
Run 'em over to the Arena. Git 'em doin
push ups. First one gives out, shoot 'em
in the head.

(TO MANDINGOS)
Welcome to Candyland, boys!
Cody runs the terrified mandingos to the arena.
Candie leans over to Schultz and says;

CALVIN CANDLE
We only get about two out of every batch
of five fighters we buy. But those two
tend to be lucky.
Ace Woody hops back up on his horse.

CALVIN CANDIE
You know Mr.Woody, I'm beginning to think
that you don't trust my judgement?
Ace Woody just smiles at his boss, and says;

ACE WOODY
Oh you know I always trust your judgement,
Boss Candie...eventually.
He rides off.
Stephen limps back to the action.

CALVIN CANDIE
Ahhh, Stephen my boy, rooms ready?

STEPHEN
All ready for your guest and his nigger.
Candie'shakes his head in mock frustration.

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, you're incorrigible.

(TO SCHULTZ

AND DJANGO)
Gentlemen, let Stephen show you to your
rooms.









/O+

CALVIN CANDLE

(CON'T)
There you can lie down and rest up
for a couple of hours. Then we'll have
some lemonade, and I'll show off some of
my finer specimens.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid.
Both Dr.Schultz and Django climb down from their horses.
Candie looks to a black little stable boy of about eight named TIMMY.

CALVIN CANDIE
Timmy boy, go take their horses for 'em.
Fix 'em up at the stable, give 'em a load
of oats.
Django hands the boy the reigns.

DJANGO
That's Fritz, this is Tony. You take good
care of 'em now.

TIMMY
Yes, sir.
Django takes an apple out of his saddle bag, and hands it to the boy.

DJANGO
Once he's in the stable, give 'em that.
He reaches back in the saddle and pulls out another one.

DJANGO
Give that one to Fritz.
Timmy leads the horses away.
The two visitors start to follow Stephen to their rooms, when
Dr.Schultz pretends to remember something;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, Monsieur Candie, about that matter about
the nigger girl we were talking about?

CALVIN CANDIE
Nigger girl?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I believe you said she spoke German?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh Yes, Hildi, what about her?








,oz.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Do you think before the demonstration you
could send her around to my room?

CALVIN CANDIE
I don't see why not.

(TO STEPHEN)
Stephen, when you get through showing
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi.
I want her cleaned up and smellin' nice,
and sent over to Dr.Schultz's room.
Stephen has to be the bearer of bad news.

STEPHEN
Actually... . Monsieur Candie... . there's
somethin' we ain't tole you yet.

CALVIN CANDIE
What?

STEPHEN
Hildi's in The Hot Box.
This gets Django's, Schultz's, and Candie's attention.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's she doin' there?

STEPHEN
What 'cha think she doin' in The Hot Box,
she bein punished.

CALVIN CANDIE
What she do?

STEPHEN
She ran away again.

CALVIN CANDIE
Jesus Christ, how many people ran away
when I was gone?

STEPHEN
Two.

CALVIN CANDIE
When did she go?

STEPHEN
Last night. They brought her back this
morning.









CALVIN CANDLE
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?
Django's hand falls to the butt of his smoke wagon. If they sicked
those dogs on his angel, he's going to just kill all these
motherfuckers right now.

STEPHEN
Lucky for her they were busy lookin' for
D'Artagnan's ass. Brown and Cody went out
lookin' for her and found her. She a little
beat up, but she did that to herself.
Runnin' through them damn bushes.
Django's hand moves away from his gun.

CALVIN CANDIE
How long she been in the box?

STEPHEN
What'cha think, all goddamn day! Little
fool got ten more days to go.

CALVIN CANDLE
Take her out.

STEPHEN

(INCREDULOUS)
Take her out? Why!

CALVIN CANDLE
Because I said so, that's why. Hildi is
my nigger. Dr.Schultz is my guest. Southern
hospitality dictates I make her available
to him.

STEPHEN
But Monsieur Candie, she just ran away?

CALVIN CANDLE
Jesus Christ Stephen, what's the point of
havin' a nigger speaks German if-you can't
wheel 'em out when you have a German guest?
I realize it's inconvenient. Still, take
her out.
(to Cora and

LARA LEE)
Lara Lee would you and Cora be responsible
for getting her cleaned up and presentable
for Dr.Schultz?
The overseers,'Tommy Giles and Hoot Peters go to The Hot.Box. While
Billy Crash goes to the well to draw a bucket of water.








Django watches them walk to The Hot Box.
Dr.Schultz's eyes shift to Django, to watch him watch this.
Stephen notices Django's interest in both The Hot Box and whoever's
sizzling in it.
The HOT BOX
itself is a large IRON SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CELL DOOR (from Yuma
Prison) built into the ground. They put a key in the lock, and the two
men lift the heavy iron door open.
REVEALING: A naked Broomhilda broiling in a small coffin like iron box
dug into the ground.
Broomhilda reacts to the sudden burst of blinding sunshine.

WHEN ...
Billy Crash TOSSES the bucket of water on her.
Django watches this.
DJANGO'S POV:.From his wide shot perspective we see them yank the NAKED
BROOMHILDA (incoherent) out of the hole.

REVENGE MUSIC PLAYS
as we move into a Sergio Leone CU of DJANGO'S FACE.
Stephen breaks the mood.

STEPHEN

(TO DJANGO)
You comin', or you wanna sleep in that
little box?
Django turns his back on the naked Broomhilda and follows Stephen and
Dr.Schultz up the front steps of The Big House.

INT - THE BIG HOUSE - DAY
Stephen leads the two guests up the big prominent sweeping staircase in
the entry way of The Big House. Then down the hallway with the guest
rooms. Dr.Schultz is shown his guest room by Stephen. Schultz enters
the room and shuts the door behind him. Stephen takes Django to the
room next door, opens the door, and leads him in.

INT - DJANGO'S GUEST ROOM - DAY
A guest room with a big feather bed, dresser drawer with a flowery
pitcher of water and basin on top of it. A little bedside table with a
lamp and a tiny bell on it.









105

STEPHEN
This one's yours, boy. That bed's damn
nice too.
Django walks over to the window, parts the curtains and peers out.
Broomhilda's gone. As he looks through the glass, snotty Stephen
rattles on in the background.

STEPHEN
Feel free to touch anything you want,
cause we burnin' all this shit once you
gone. I'll have somebody knock on the
door when the demonstration ready.
Django sits down on the bed.
Stephen turns to leave.

DJANGO
Not so fast.

STEPHEN
I got more important things to do then
jaw with you.

DJANGO
Nigger, when I say stop you plant roots.
Both the words and the tone stop Stephen dead. He turns around.

DJANGO
This tiny bell on this little table...
.is this for you? I ring this, you
do fer me?

STEPHEN
Me or somebody.
Django reaches over and picks up the bell.
(a soft) DING-A-LING

STEPHEN

(UNAMUSED)
What 'cha want?

DJANGO
I want you to pour some water in that
bowl for my wash up.
Stephen does what he's told, but with attitude.









)O'
Django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone.
Once Stephen's done, Django stands up from the bed.

DJANGO
Gimmie.
Stephen hands him the basin full of water.
Django takes it from him.
Then throws the water in Stephen's face.
The dripping wet old slave can do nothing against this free man.

DJANGO
Whatsamatter Stephen, you don't like
that?
Django takes his hand and SLAPS the old man hard across the face
knocking him to the floor;

DJANGO
That's my kinda bell ringin'. Git up.
The old man timidly, slowly, and shaky rises off the floor - as soon as
he does - Django SLAPS HIM TO THE FLOOR again.
Then Django sits back down on the bed, looking at the old man on the
floor below his knees.

DJANGO
I've known me House Niggers like you my
whole life. Play your dog tricks with your
Massa'. Ya' lip off to him every now an'
then, as long as ya' keep it funny. He
rolls his eyes and puts up with it, and
all the white folks think it's so cute.
Meanwhile you got all these niggas round
here hoppin' and jumpin' to stay on your
good side. Well this time Snowball, you
gonna listen to me. You got anymore sass
you wanna sling my way, before they give
us a mandingo demonstration, I'm gonna
give this whole motherfuckin plantation
a demonstration, of ME beatin' the BLACK
off your ass. I will make you drop your
drawers, I'll take off my belt, and I will
Wup' your bare ass with it, in front of
every nigga on this plantation. And after
I do that, let's see you play the rooster
round here.









X07

STEPHEN
Calvin wouldn't. let you do it.

DJANGO
Oh that's right, he gives you first name
privileges... . ain't that cute. Sass me
me again nigger, see what happen'.
Stephen lying on the floor, bites his tongue.

DJANGO
That's what I thought. Now git outta"here.
With as much dignity as he can muster, Stephen stands up.
Before he leaves, Django tells him;,

DJANGO
When I ring this bell, you better come
a runnin'. You - not nobody else. While
I'm on this property, you my nigger
Snowball.
Stephen leaves.
Django lies down on the bed. He covers his eyes with his arm.
A door joins Django and Schultz's room. The adjoining door opens, and
Schultz stands there.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Was that wise?
Django doesn't remove his arm from.his eyes.

DJANGO
He ain't tellin' nobody 'bout that.
That's all that needs to be said.

INT - HALLWAY (BIG HOUSE) - DAY
Lara Lee, Cora, and a traumatized, but cleaned up (she's dressed in a
domestic maid uniform) Broomhilda stand outside Dr.Schultz's door,
after Calvin's sister raps on it.
Dr.Schultz opens the door.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Hello ladies.









DOG

LARA LEE
Dr.Schultz, may I introduce to you,
Hildi. Hildi, this is Dr.Schultz, he
speaks German.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO BROOMHILDA)
I've been informed you do as well.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
It would be my, pleasure to speak with you
in German.
Schultz acts for the benefit of Miss Lara's astonishment.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Astonishing.

(IN GERMAN)
Please come inside Fraulein.
She does, and just'as Lara Lee is to say something, Schultz says,
"Thank You very much," and closes the door in her face. Miss Lara looks
to her Mammy, and the two women head off nonplussed.

INT - SCHULTZ'S GUEST ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - LATE AFTERNOON
With the door closed, Schultz turns to the weak, frightened,
disoriented girl.
He gives her a pleasant smile.
Dr.SCHULTZ
They call you Hildi, but your real name
is Broomhilda, isn't it?

BROOMHILDA
Yes. How do you know that?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Stands to reason who ever taught you
German would also give you a German name.
Can I pour you a glass of water,
Broomhilda?
Hearing her name being spoke properly for the first time in awhile, not
to mention with a German accent, does have a bit of a calming influence
on the frightened girl.









107

WE CUT TO DJANGO
on the other side of the adjoining door, listening, waiting for his cue
to present himself.
BACK TO BROOMHILDA AND Dr.SCHULTZ
As Dr.Schultz calmly pours the young lady a glass of water, he begins
talking to her in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
I'm aware you haven't spoken German in
a long while. So I'll talk slowly.
I'm only speaking German to you now,
Broomhilda, in case Candie's people are
listening to us. Myself and a mutual
friend of ours, have gone through a lot
of trouble, and rode a lot of miles, to
find you fraulein - to rescue you.
He hands her a tall clear glass of water.
She looks at him weird, rescue me?
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Please drink.
She absentmindedly obeys.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(.GERMAN).
Now it's myself and our mutual friend's
intention to take you away from here
forever.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
I don't got any friends.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Yes you do.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
Who?
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
I can't tell you. Our mutual friend has a
flair for the dramatic, and he wants to
surprise you.









!!0

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
Where is he?
He points at the adjoining door.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Standing right behind that door.
Her head moves in the direction of the door.
He looks to the young woman;
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Promise me you won't scream?
She nods her head, yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Say, I promise.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
I promise.
Dr.Schultz moves to the door, and lightly raps on it.
The door knob turns.
The door slowly opens revealing...
Her husband Django, but different, all cowboyed out and cleaned up.
He smiles at her, and says;

DJANGO
Hey Little Trouble Maker.
Obviously a pet name between them.
Broomhilda goes into a bit of shock...
.first she loses strength in her wrist, so the glass tips over, and
the water spills on the floor ...
.followed quickly by herself spilling on the floor in a dead. faint.









1/1
The two men look at the woman on the floor, then at each other;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You silver tongued devil you.

MONTAGE
WE DISSOLVE to later, as we see Dr.Schultz and Django explain what-
they're doing there, who they're pretending to be, and what their plan
is to Broomhilda. We hear a woman whistle a soft pretty tune on the
soundtrack. It's not a happy tune.. .per se. But it's pretty, and
vaguely optimistic ...
WE DISSOLVE TO The SLAVE PEN
The doomed men who didn't sell at Greenville, brooding Rodney and
Chester and Chicken Charly, spend their last night at Candyland
sleeping under the stars in The Slave Pen. The same whistling tune
continues over this scene.
Rodney sees, The whole slave selling and buying group, Django,
Dr.Schultz, Candie, Bartholomew, Moguy, Ace Woody, Brown and Cody, and
the Overseers, walk across the plantation grounds on their way to
The Arena. Laughin' and joshin' all the way. The hatred Rodney feels
for that group of men burns inside him like a red hot poker.
A study in powerless fury.

DISSOLVE TO BROOMHILDA SETTING THE DINNER TABLE
in the dining room of The Big House with its knives, spoons and forks.
She's all by herself as she goes through this duty.
The whistling tune we've been listening to has been coming from
Broomhilda whistling as she sets the table.
Suddenly out of the darkness of the background appears Stephen.

STEPHEN
What you. whistlin', girl?
Broomhilda stops whistling and spins surprised in Stephen's direction.

STEPHEN
What was you whistlin'?

BROOMHILDA
Oh nuttin'.

STEPHEN
You weren't whistlin' nothin', you were
whistlin' somethin'. What'cha whistlin'?

BROOMHILDA
I dunno. Somethin' I heard. I don't know
no.name.









)/Z

STEPHEN
It's kinder pretty.
She doesn't say anything in return.

STEPHEN
That was a compliment.

BROOMHILDA
Thank you.
Stephen steps out of the shadows into the light closer to Broomhilda.

STEPHEN
I'm just sayin', two days ago you wus' in
such misery here, you hadda run off. So you
run off, we catch your ass an' drag you back.
Then we stick your bare ass to sizzle in
The Hot Box for' 'bout ten hours. Now here
you are two days later, whistlin' while you
work. I'm just sayin', I.wouldn' think you'd
have a hellva lot to whistle 'bout.
.I'm jus' sayin'.
He watches the effect his words have on Broomhilda's face.

BROOMHILDA
I'm done here, may I be excused?

STEPHEN
Yes you may.
She moves off to another part of the house.
He watches her shuffle off.

INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
Later that evening, Django and a lot of other white people (Calvin
Candie, Lara Lee, Moguy, and Dr.Schultz) sat around the dinner table.
They are being served by the black people we've come to know at
Candyland (Stephen, Cora, and because Dr.Schultz likes her Broomhilda).
Along with an army of DOMESTIC SLAVES acting as wait service.
Knowing Django's a slaver, and for his dinner table privileges, the
Domestic Slaves despise Django.
Even Broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver, even
though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade.
We pick up the conversation in mid-negotiation.









"5.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Look Monsieur Candle, they were all fine
specimens, no doubt about it. But the
best three, by far, were Sampson, Goldie,
and Eskimo Joe. - By the way, why's he
called Eskimo Joe?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh you never know how these nigger nicknames
get started. His name was Joe-...maybe one
day he said he was cold.. .who knows?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Irregardless, we all know Samson's your
best, and you'll never sell him and I can
see why, he's a champion.

CALVIN CANDIE
All three are champions.
Django contradicts, as he chews his steak;

DJANGO
Samson's the champion. The other two
are pretty good.
All the Domestic Slaves around the table STIFFEN at witnessing Django
contradict Calvin Candie.
Including Broomhilda, who's wielding the Gravy Boat. After Django says
that, while in shock, she over pours beef gravy on Lara Lee's mashed
potatoes.

LARA LEE
Hildi!
Broomhilda snaps back.
Instead of getting angry, Candle seems to reflect on that analysis,
then issues his own appraisal;

CALVIN CANDIE
Can Eskimo Joe whip Sampson, no. Can he
take Goldie, probably not - Goldie's the
best dirty fightin' nigger I ever saw. But as
long as you don't put 'em up against those
two., Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass.

DJANGO
Maybe.
The Domestics FREEZE for a jerky second when Django says that.









//

F
Dr.SCHULTZ
You must understand, Monsieur Candie, while
admittedly a .neophyte in the nigger fight
game, I do have a bit of a background in
the European traveling circus. Hence, I
have big ideas when it comes to presentation.
I need something more then just a big nigger.
He needs to have panache. A sense of showmanship.
I want to be able to . bill. him as. The Black Hercules.
I said., and I quote; "I would pay top dollar
for the, right nigger." Now I'm not saying
Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger - per se ...
but is he right as rain ... ?
Everyone waits for Calvin's response. He milks the moment by taking a
sip of his mint julep, then says;

CALVIN CANDIE
Dr.Schultz, i will have you know, there
is no one in the nigger fight game that
appreciates the value of showmanship
more then, Monsieur Calvin J. Candie. But
one must not forget the most important
thing in the nigger fight game.

(BEAT)
A nigger that can win fights. That should
be your first, second, third, four, and
fifth concern. After you have that, and
you know you have that, then, you can
start to implement a grande design. But
since I enjoy oldest man 'at the table
status - beating Moguy by one year for
that honor allow the old sage to advise,
first things first.
Broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans.
Dr.Schultz says something pleasant to her in German..
She smiles, and says something pleasant back.

CALVIN CANDIE
I see you two gettin' on?
Dr.Schultz breaks into a wide grin;
Dr.SCHULTZ
.Famously.

(DRAMATIC PAUSE)
Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what
it's like not to hear you native tongue
for four years.

CALVIN CANDIE
Hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.









Â»5
Everybody at the table chuckles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I can't express the joy I felt conversing
in my mother tongue. And Broomhilda is a
charming conversation companion.
As Broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for Moguy, Lara Lee notices
how Django and Broomhilda look and try not to look at each other.
Stephen enters the room with a fresh mint julep for Monsieur Candie.

LARA LEE
I don't know doctor, you can lay on all
the German sweet talk you want, but it
looks like this ponys got big eyes for
Django.
Lara Lee has no idea how right she is, but when she said it, all three,
Django, Broomhilda, and Schultz, involuntarily jerk.

AND ...
.STEPHEN sees it.
Schultz covers the jerk with more of his verbal gobbilty gook.
Except for Stephen, no one else was the wiser.
Broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for the
kitchen.
Stephen watches her go, then looks at Django, then hands Candie his
mint julep, and goes into a broad routine for the table's benefit.

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, you're amazing. I haven't finished
a drink in this house in twenty years.

STEPHEN
When a man likes a cold drink, a man likes
a COLD drink.
Chuckle... . chuckle...

CALVIN CANDIE
Did you overhear that joke I said about
me spending two weeks in Boston

STEPHEN

(MOCK INDIGNANT)
You don't have any idea the work I do
to see food gets on the table.









1/6

CALVIN CANDIE
What does that hafta do with the price of
Tea in China?

STEPHEN
You think when I'm in that kitchen, I got
nothin' better to do then listen in here
to you tellin' unfunny jokes?
Chuckle... . chuckle...

CALVIN CANDIE

(MOCK INDIGNATION)
What? They laughed!

STEPHEN
Of course they laughed, their parents
raised them right. When they're a guest
in somebody's house, and the master of
of the house thinks he's- funny, you
suppose to laugh. They'd be rude not to.
Chuckle... .chuckle...
They play their little comedy routine for all it's worth.

CALVIN CANDIE
No it was really funny,

(TO TABLE)
wasn't it?

STEPHEN
Now what do you expect these people to
say? What you need to do is stop
embarrassing your guest.

(TO TABLE)
Everybody don't laugh at him, you're being
polite, I understand, you mean well, but
it just encourages him.
Chuckle-chuckle...
As the white folks chuckle, Stephen moves back into the kitchen.

TNT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
Once Stephen enters the kitchen, his smile melts away, and he locks
eyes on Broomhilda. He moves over to her.

STEPHEN
You know that nigger?
/ï¿½ She spins around.









11 7

BROOMHILDAÂ€¢
Who?

STEPHEN
Don't stall me bitch, you know who?

BROOMHILDA
At the table? I don't know him.

STEPHEN.
You don't know him?

BROOMHILDA
No.

STEPHEN
You wouldn't lie to me now, would you?
She shakes her head, no.
Stephen looks at her skeptical.

STEPHEN
Okay, if you say so.

BACK TO DINNER TABLE
Pick it up again in mid-negotiation.

DJANGO
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt
about it. But if it was my money, I
wouldn't pay twelve thousand dollars
for him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What would your price be?

DJANGO
Well, if I ,was inclined to be generous,.
and I don't know why I would be inclined
to be generous... . nine thousand ... . maybe.
Candie's lawyer chimes in.

MOGUY
But the real question is, not how much
he cost, but how much he can earn?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django?

DJANGO
In a years time, seven or eight fights -
outside of Mississippi - where his Candyland
pedigree weren't well known - Virginia...

(CON'T)









11Y

DJANGO

(CON'T)
Georgia -- all goes well ...twenty to twenty
one thousand dollars.

CALVIN CANDIE
Precisely Bright Boy, good on ya. Any way
you cut that cake, that spells profit.
Not to, mention a years worth of action at
the big table in a blood sport with a
winner nigger. However let me reclarify
how this whole negotiation came about.
It wasn't me who came to you to sell a
nigger, it was you who approached me to
buy one. Now that nine thousand dollar
figure Bright Boy was banding about,
ain't too far off from right. And if I
wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, I
could sell 'em any day of the week.
But like you said in Greenville doctor,
I don't wanna sell 'em. It was only your
ridiculous offer of twelve thousand
dollars that would make me consider it.
Dr.Schultz considers'Calvin Candie's words, then suddenly says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You know Monsieur Candie... . you do possess
the power of persuasion.
Candie smiles at that remark.
Then SUDDENLY Schultz SLAPS the table hard with his hand, and says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Why not! Monsieur Candie, you have a deal,
Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!
The White people at the table get very happy.
Dr.Schultz continues;
Dr.SCHULTZ
However, that is a tremendous amount of
money. And the way you have your Mr.Moguy,
I have a lawyer, a persnickety man named
Tuttle. And I would need my man to draw
up a legal contract before I would feel
comfortable exchanging that amount of
money for flesh. Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my
choosing. So say I return in about five
days time with my Mr.Tuttle. And then my
Mr.Tuttle and your Mr.Moguy can hash out
the finer points between themselves.









117

CALVIN CANDIE
Splendid.

(CALLING TO

THE KITCHEN)
Stephen, time for dessert!
Stephen, Cora, Broomhilda, and the other Domestics come out of the
kitchen to clear away the dirty dishes.
Broomhilda goes to Calvin.

BROOMHILDA
Can I take away your dishes, Monsieur Candle?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes you may, Hildi.
She begins gathering the dirty dishes.
Candie looks up at her as she works.

CALVIN CANDIE
So Hildi, how you like servin at the big
table in the big house?

BROOMHILDA
I like it a lot Monsieur Candle.

CALVIN CANDIE
It's a lot better then sizzling in that
hot box, or draggin' your ass through a
bramble bush, ain't it?

BROOMHILDA
Yes 'em.
With Candie interrogating Broomhilda, Django tenses up.
Stephen clocks this.
Stephen decides to test Django's reaction.

STEPHEN
You know Monsieur Candle, the doctor might
be interested in seein' Hildi's "peeled"
back. Seein' as he don't see many niggers
where he from.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
When you was alone with Hildi here, didja
just speak German, or did ya git her
clothes off?









!20
Dr.SCHULTZ
We just spoke.

CALVIN CANDIE
So you haven't seen her back?
Dr.SCHULTZ
No I haven't.

CALVIN CANDIE
Then Stephen's right, you would probably
find this interesting. Hildi, take off
your dress, and show us your back.
Django hears this.
Broomhilda instinctively shoots a look to Django.
Stephen clocks it.

LARA LEE
Calvin, I just got her all dressed up
and looking nice.

CALVIN CANDIE
But Lara Lee, Dr.Schultz is from Dusseldorf,
they don't got niggers there. And he's a
man of medicine. I'm sure it would
fascinate him, the niggers endurance for
pain. I mean Hildi got something like
fifteen lashes on her back. Lara Lee get
one, she'd lose her mind. These niggers
are tough, no doubt about it.

LARA LEE
Calvin, we are eating - dessert, no less.
Ain't no one wanna see her whipped up back.
Django continues to watching this play out.
Stephen watches him.
Candie folds.

CALVIN CANDIE
Okay okay Lara. Maybe after dinner.
During the brandies.
Broomhilda - dismissed - takes Calvin's dishes and heads back into the
kitchen.
Stephen takes one more look at Django, and follows Broomhilda behind
the kitchen door.









121

INT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
In the kitchen with the OTHER DOMESTICS, Stephen says to Broomhilda;

STEPHEN
I thought you said you didn't know him?
Broomhilda turns around.

BROOMHILDA
Huh?
Stephen approaches her, the other Domestics get quiet and watch.

STEPHEN
I said, you said, you didn't know him?

BROOMHILDA
I don't.

STEPHEN
Yes you do.

BROOMHILDA
Mister Stephen, I don't.

STEPHEN
Why you lyin to me?
As tears begin to well in her eyes.

BROOMBILDA
I ain't.

STEPHEN
Why you cryin'?

BROOMHILDA
Because you're scarin' me.

STEPHEN
Why am I scarin' you?

BROOMHILDA
Because you're scary.
Things have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen, that the dinner
table conversation begins to bleed inside.
We hear Dr.Schultz in the next room say;
Dr.SCHULTZ (OS)
.to speak German,with Hildi this
afternoon was positively soul enriching.
Stephen hears this, he's starting to get the idea.









1ZL
His eyes to to Broomhilda.

STEPHEN
You, stay in the kitchen.
Stephen moves to the kitchen door, swings it open, and watches
Dr.Schultz prepare to proposition Candie for Broomhilda. Stephen knows
these two jokers (Django and Schultz) are up to something, and now he's
just figured it out.

INT - DINNER TABLE (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
Dr.SCHULTZ
You indicated earlier you would be
willing to part with Hildi?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes siree bob I did.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well in that case allow me to propose
another proposition?
In full "Ole Jimmie" performance, Stephen BARGES in the room,
INTERRUPTING Dr.Schultz.

STEPHEN
- Monsieur Candie?

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, you just interrupted Dr.Schultz.

STEPHEN
(to Dr.Schultz)
Oh, I do apologize, doctor. My hearin'
ain't worth a damn these days.

(TO CANDIE)
Monsieur Candie, I need a word with you in
the kitchen.

CALVIN CANDIE
What, you mean get outta my chair?

STEPHEN
If you could manage it. It's about dessert.

CALVIN CANDIE
What about dessert?

STEPHEN
I would rather tell you in private.

CALVIN CANDIE
We're having rhubarb pie, what sort of
melodrama could be brewing back there?









123
Stephen bends down and whispers in his ear;

STEPHEN
Meet me in the library.
Well that's a horse of a different color. That means whatever Stephen
has to say, hasn't anything to do with rhubarb pie. "Meet me in the
library" is their secret signal.

CALVIN CANDIE
Fine friend Stephen, I'll be along momentarily.
Stephen exits.
Candie stands up from his chair and addresses the table.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well as you can see, talented no doubt as
they are in the kitchen, from time to
time, adult supervision is required.
If you'll excuse me a moment.
Candie exits.

TNT - LIBRARY (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
A masculine sanctuary for Calvin Candie. Walls of perfectly bound
books. Stuffed animal heads (deer, boar) that he's shot, sit mounted on
the walls. There's comfy red leather chairs and a bar in the globe.
When WE CUT TO this room, we cut to Stephen sitting in one of the red
leather chairs, drinking a brandy out of a brandy sifter.
Calvin enters the room, sees Stephen sitting in the chair, drinking his
brandy, and doesn't bat an eye. It appears, in this room, Calvin's and
Stephen's life long friendship exits on a different plane. Outside of
outside eyes, in this room, all pretense of master and slave is
dropped, and the number one and number two.. men of Candyland can talk
turkey.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's the matter?

STEPHEN
Those motherfuckers ain't here to buy no
mandingos. They want that girl. -

CALVIN CANDIE
What the hell you talkin' about?

STEPHEN
They playin your ass for a fool, that's
what I'm talkin' bout. They ain't here
for no muscle bound Jimmie, they here for
that girl.









CALVIN CANDIE
What girl, Hildi?

STEPHEN
Yeah, Hildi. The niggers know each other.

CALVIN CANDIE
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

STEPHEN
Did he give you any money?

CALVIN CANDIE
Well not yet, but -

STEPHEN
- Then he didn't R ..Y diddly, not yet no
how. But he was just about to buy, who he
came here to buy, when I interrupted him.
Thank you Stephen - you're welcome Calvin.

CALVIN CANDIE
Where you gettin' all this? Why would they
go through all that trouble, to. buy a
nigger with a chewed up back, ain't worth
five hundred dollars?

STEPHEN
Well they're doin' it cause Django's in
love with Hildi. She's probably his wife.
Now why that German gives a fuck about
who that uppity son-of-a--bitch is in love
with, I'm sure I don't know.

CALVIN CANDIE
If she's who they want, why the whole
snake oil pitch about mandingos?

STEPHEN
Because you wouldn't pay no never mind
to four hundred dollar. But twelve
thousand got you real friendly.
Calvin thinks ...
.as per usual, Stephen's right.

CALVIN CANDIE
Those lyin' goddamn.time wastin'
sonsabitches!

(LOUDER)
Sonsabitches! You just watch, I'm gonna
fix their wagon but good! Stephen, we
.gonna have us a Candyland tar and
feathering!









FL5

STEPHEN
Now Calvin.. .not that I wouldn't enjoy
seein' something like that ... . but why
don't you sit down and let's talk about this.

CALVIN CANDLE
I let a goddamn nigger and nigger lovin'
huckster insinuate themselves at my
dinner table, and play this whole goddamn
plantation for a fool!

STEPHEN
Calm-the-fuck-down, sit down, and let's
discuss this.
A frustrated Calvin finally collapses in the chair.

STEPHEN
Now look, you knew, and I knew, there
was something up with these two. We just
didn't know what. But now we do. They
don't want you to know how bad they want
that girl. But these ole boys have rode
a lotta miles, went t6 a whole lotta
trouble, and done spread a whole lotta
bull to get this girl. They must want her
mighty bad. Way I see it, ain't nothin'
changed. They wanna buy a nigger, you
wanna sell a nigger.The only thing done
changed is the advantage.

(BEAT)
Now we got it. .So let's go back in there
and busts these motherfucker's chops.

INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
The Dinner Table Guests listen to Lara Lee'Candie-Fitzwilly hold court
melodramatically ... . Till ... . Calvin Candie enters the room from the
kitchen door.
Lara Lee, oblivious to her brothers change in demeanor, blurts out upon

SEEING HIM;

LARA LEE
There you are! I was beginning to think
you and that of crow ran off together.
Schultz and Django feel the change in their host's demeanor, as he
stares down the table at them.

CALVIN CANDLE
That'd be a hellva note, wouldn't it
Lara Lee?

(CON'T)









1Z J

CALVIN CANDIE

(CON'T)
Lara Lee, I just looked out the big winda.
Ace Woody's out there dealin' with some
shady slaver sellin' a passel of Ponys.
Would you be a dear and go out there and
give them gals an eyeball. That of boy
knows everything to know 'bout mandingos,
But he don't know diddly 'bout black puddin'.
Lara Lee excuses herself and leaves the room, as she goes out,
Bartholomew, with his Sawed Off Shotgun, comes.in behind Schultz and
Django.

CALVIN CANDIE
Can I ask you two gentlemen to look over
your shoulder?
Schultz and Django do, and see Bartholomew with his sawed off shotgun
pointing at them.
Calvin Candie removes his arm from behind his back, and in his hand
he's holding a big ugly hammer.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now lay your palms flat on the table top.
They put their palms on the table.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now you lift those palms off that turtle
shell table top, Bartholomew gonna let
loose with both barrels of that sawed off.
There's been a lotta lies said around this
table tonight-but that.. .you can believe.

(BEAT)
Mr.Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect
the pistols hangin' on those boys'hips?
Mr.Moguy does.
Holding the hammer in his hand, Candie continues to hold court.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now where were we? Oh yes, I do believe you
were just getting ready to make me a
proposition to buy Broomhilda. Right?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Right.

CALVIN CANDIE

(YELLING TO

STEPHEN)
Stephen! Bring out Hildi!








Ix?
Stephen enters the dining room through the kitchen door, holding
roughly in his grip, Broomhilda. He holds a small Derringer pistol
against the side of her head.
Django and Schultz react.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now it should be quite clear by now I know
you're not here to buy no mandingos.
Reason y'all came to Candyland, is y'all
want Broomhilda. But y'all don't want me
to know how much you want 'er. So instead,
you waste my time with all this Eskimo Joe
horseshit.

(TO STEPHEN)
Stephen, put her in that chair.
Stephen sits the young lady down in Moguy's old chair.
With their palms against the table, unarmed, Django and Schultz
silently watch Candie's next move.
Candie, still holding the hammer, continues.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now the way I see it, ain't nothin' changed..
You still wanna buy a nigger, I still wanna
sell one. So, with that in mind, in Greenville,
Dr.Schultz, you yourself said, "For the Right
Nigger you'd be willing to pay what some would
consider a ridiculous amount." To which, me
myself said, "What is your definition of
ridiculous?" To which you said, "Twelve
thousand dollars."
Now considering you two have ridden a whole
lotta miles, went to a whole lotta trouble,
and done spread a whole lotta bull, to
purchase the lovely lady to my left, it would
appear that Broomhilda is, "The Right Nigger."
And if y'all wanna leave Candyland with
Broomhilda, the price is twelve thousand dollars.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I take it you prefer the take it or leave
it style of negotiating.
Candie continuing to hold the hammer continues.

CALVIN CANDIE
Under the laws of Chickasaw County,
Broomhilda is my property. And I can do
anything with my property I so desire.
He brings the big hammer down hard on the dinner table, making
everybody jump.









IN

CALVIN CANDIE
And if you think my price for this nigger
is too steep, what I'm gonna desire to do
is, take this hammer and beat her ass to
death with it. Right in front of both y'all.
He SMASHES the arm rest of the chair Broomhilda's sitting in.

CALVIN CANDIE
Put up or shut up, Schultz. You wanna save
this nigger bitch, you gonna pay my price.
Dr.SCHULTZ
May I lift my hands from the table top in
order to remove my billfold?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes you may.
Dr.Schultz removes his long brown leather billfold from his gray suit
jacket, and says;,
Dr.SCHULTZ
Easy come, easy go.
He slides the billfold down the table to Candie. The plantation owner
takes out the money, does a quick count, then looks down the table at
the seated Schultz, and says;

CALVIN CANDIE
Pleasure doin' business with you.

TIME CUT

INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
INSERT: Calvin signing over Broomhilda's BILL OF SALE.
.Moguy signs as a witness.
Broomhilda stands next to Django, and watches her Master sign her
freedom papers.
Dr.Schultz sits off by himself. He's very disturbed.
All the white people with Calvin Candie are happy and celebrate
Candie's successes with glasses of Brandy. Lara Lee, Ace Woody, and
Brown and Cody have joined the' celebration.
For an experienced horsetrader, the just concluded transaction is a
thing of legend. He just sold a Pony, with a tore up back, and a
runaway "r" burned in her cheek - ain't worth five hundred
dollars- for twelve thousand.








Stephen smiles and laughs it up with everybody else.
The Other domestics bring out little plates of rhubarb pie, and buzz
around pouring coffee for the white people.
Candie walks over to the seated Schultz, he carries a small plate of
rhubarb pie with him.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
Rhubarb pie?
Schultz looks at the pie and the man.
Dr.SCHULTZ
No.

CALVIN CANDIE
Are you brooding 'bout me getting the best
of ya?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Actually, I was thinking of that poor
devil you fed to the dogs today, D'Artagnan.
And I was wondering what Dumas would make of
all this.
Calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs. Broomhilda's
bill of sale, and her freedom papers. As he says the following he
examines he papers.

CALVIN CANDIE
Dumas...?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Alexander Dumas. He wrote "The Three Musketeers."
I figured you must be an admirer. You named
your slave after that novel's lead character.
If Alexander Dumas had been there today, I
wonder what he would of made of it?

CALVIN CANDIE
You doubt he'd approve?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes his approval would be a dubious proposition
at best.

CALVIN CANDIE
Soft hearted Frenchy?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Alexander Dumas is black.









1 30
Schultz rises, puts the papers in his back pocket, .looks to his two
companions, Django and Broomhilda, and says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
We got it, let's go.

(TO CANDIE)
Normally Monsieur Candie, I would say,
auf wiedersehen. But since what auf wiedersehen
actually means is, till I see you again,
and since I never wish to see you again,
to you sir, I say, goodbye.
Schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit.
When Calvin says to the German's back;

CALVIN CANDIE
One more moment, Doc!
Dr.SCHULTZ
What?

CALVIN CANDIE
It's a custom here in the South, once a
business deal is concluded, for the two
parties to shake hands. It implies good
faith.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm not from the South.
He turns to leave.

CALVIN CANDIE
You're in my house, doctor, I'm afraid
I must insist.
This turns Schultz around.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Insist what...? That I shake your hand
before I leave? Then I'm afraid I must
insist in the opposite direction.
Calvin walks closer to the German doctor.

CALVIN CANDIE
You know what I think you are?
Dr.SCHULTZ
What you think I am? No I don't.









1310,

CALVIN CANDLE
I think you are a bad loser.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And I think you're an abysmal winner.

CALVIN CANDLE
Never the less, here in Chickasaw County
a deal ain't done till the two parties have
shook hands. Even after all this paper
signin', don't mean shit you don't shake my hand.
Dr.SCHULTZ
If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw
away twelve thousand dollars...?
I don't think so.
Schultz looks to Django and Broomhilda.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Let's go.

CALVIN CANDIE
Bartholomew, if she tries to leave here
before this German shakes my hand.
Cut 'er down.
Schultz looks to Django... . then to Candle..
.and then with a smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye, asks

CANDLE;
Dr.SCHULTZ.
You really want me to shake your hand?
Django gets it.

CALVIN CANDIE
I insist.

DR
-Schultz smiles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, if you insist.
Django goes to stop him...









1 714
The German crosses toward Candie, offering him his hand...
Candie offers his hand to Schultz...
The small DERRINGER POPS into Schultz's outstretched hand...

POP!
He SHOOTS CALVIN CANDIE in the heart.
Candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart, and he
falls to the floor.
Everybody is stunned.
Schultz looks to Django.
Django looks back.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO DJANGO)
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.
Dr.SCHULTZ is BLOWN APART by Bartholomew's SAWED OFF SHOTGUN.
The room comes to its senses and attacks Django and Broomhilda.

FADE TO BLACK








We FADE UP FROM BLACK to see:
The soles of Django's bare feet. A rope is tied around the ankles, and
it's obvious he's been strung up, upside down.
The CAMERA moves down his naked body, down his legs (we see his wrists
are'bound with ropes to his thigh), down his bare buttocks, down his
whip scarred back, to the back of his head which hovers just about
three inches from the barn yard wooden floor.

INT - BARN - AFTERNOON
Eight year old stable boy, Timmy, wipes the unconscious Django's face
with a wet rag. They are all alone in the barn.
Django begins to come to ...

TIMMY

(SHHH'S HIM)
Act like you still sleepin'.

DJANGO
Where's Broomhilda?

TIMMY
Who?

DJANGO
Hildi, the slave girl that ran away a
couple of days ago. They had her in The
Hot Box.

TIMMY
I don't know 'bout no girl.

DJANGO
How 'bout that German white man I came
here with?

TIMMY
Oh he's dead. His body's over there.
Django twists upside down on the rope, and sees the corpse of his
friend King Schultz dead on the filthy barn yard floor. The sight of
the lifeless carcass of the doctor fills Django with pain and anger.
Just then head overseer Ace Woody walks in the barn.
Upon seeing Ace, Timmy hightails it out of there, Ace throws an empty
bucket at the fleeing boy.

ACE WOODY
Git on outta here, boy!









133
Django, slightly..swaying to and fro from the rope, looks upside down
at Ace Woody, all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie, which
makes him look a bit like Wyatt Earp.

ACE WOODY
So y'all bounty hunters,.huh?
Django thinks, "How does he know?"

ACE WOODY
I knew there was something fishy 'bout, y'all.
We found your wanted posters and book of figures
in your saddle bags. I gotta say, ain't never
heard of no black bounty hunter before. A black
boy paid to kill white men? How did ya like that
line of work?
Django retorts, upside down.

DJANGO
Well, it turns out I was a natural.
Ace woody laughs.

ACE WOODY
Boy, people 'round here are cross wit you.
Ace Woody pulls up a tiny milking stool, and sits down on it, a body
length from the hanging man.

ACE WOODY
See Boss Man was a rather beloved figure
'round here. Now he's dead as fried chicken,
everyone 'round here blames you.
Ace Woody opens his black suit jacket, we see not only does he wear a
gun and holster around his waist, he carries a HUGE BOWIE KNIFE ina
shoulder holster. He removes the big blade from its sheath.

ACE WOODY
Yep, Boss Man's gone. Poor Calvin. Poor
goddamn Calvin. We're burnin' him in a few
hours. At sunset. Should be real pretty.
However ... . I don't think you're gonna be
able to attend.
Ace takes the Bowie Knife and THROWS IT...
. IT LANDS stuck in the wooden barn yard floor, four inches from
Django's face.
Ace Woody slowly rises up from the tiny milking stool, and slowly walks
the length of the floor between him and Django, pulls the blade out of
the floor, and walks back to his stool, and sits back down.
As he does this, he says;









ACE WOODY
Now I understand you didn't really have
nuttin' to do wit it. It's that German
sunbitch the trouble maker. You just wanted
to git your girl, and hightail your nigger
asses outta here. Now I appreciate that.
But grieving folks 'round here need someone
to blame. And I guess they figure if you
hadn't brought your black ass 'round here
in the first place, Boss Man still be alive.
And you know what, they got a point.
He THROWS the knife again...
.this time IT LANDS in the floor two inches from Django's face.
He walks the same path from the knife and back to the tiny stool.
As he does he says;

ACE WOODY
Now when it comes to making a nigger regret
the error of his ways, believe me when I.
tell you, I know every goddamn trick in the
book. Now there's a lotta ass busters out
there try an' git creative with the way they
bust ass. But me... .I always found the best
methods are, tried and true.
He THROWS the knife again...
Django JERKS his head back ...
.and the knife LANDS in the floor, right where Django's head was.
Ace Woody stands up, walks the floor to the Bowie, yanks it out of the
wood., and straightens up, standing right beside the hanging upside down
naked black man. Ace talks confidentially to the bound man at his
mercy.

ACE WOODY
You know Blackie, here at Candyland, I had
me a real sweet deal. These last eleven years
training Calvin's mandingos I made me more
money I made my whole goddamn life.
And no end in sight, neither.

(BEAT)
Then you came along. Knocked me right off
that perch I was sittin' pretty on. You think
Miss Lara gonna be as.interested in
mandingos as her brother?
Uuummmm...I don't think so. What I think,
is you done fucked up my good thang.
So when it comes to you, Django boy, you
could say I gotta axe to grind.









IJS
He grabs a handfull of Django's genitals in his fist. He takes his big
Bowie, and places the razor sharp BLADE against Django's nut sack.
Django dances at the end of the rope like live bait on a fishing pole.

ACE WOODY
How's the blade of that Bowie feel against
your ball sack, Blackie? A Bowie right off
the wet stone. Now that's what I call sharp.
Django dances some more ...

ACE WOODY
Yep nigger, I'm gonna snip them nuts.

(BREATH)
On the count of three.

DJANGO SCREAMS:

DJANGO

NO!!!!

ACE WOODY

ONE ...

DJANGO

NO DON'T DO IT!!!!!

ACE WOODY
Got to do it, boy. TWO...

DJANGO

NO!!!! !
Just then Stephen appears in the entrance of the barn/blacksmith
facility. He's holding Django's clothes in a bundle under his arm.

STEPHEN
Cap't, Miss Lara lookin' for you. She wanna
talk about the Old Man's funeral.
Oh, and she changed her mind 'bout snippin'
Django. She gonna give 'em to the LeQuint
Dickey people.
While still keeping a firm grip on Django's'junk, Ace Woody says;

ACE WOODY
Well she didn't waste a minute tellin' me.
Ace Woody looks down at Django, both men get over the aborted emotion
of what almost happened.

ACE WOODY

(TO DJANGO)
How disappointing.









171

ACE WOODY

(TO STEPHEN)
Where she at?

STEPHEN
She in the big house. The kitchen.
Ace turns to leave, Stephen goes over to a big fiery furnace in the
blacksmith barn, and begins poking a LONG POKER which lies buried in
the fire.
Django's clothes are dumped by the furnace.

ACE WOODY
You gonna look after our friend?
As, he plays with the poker in the fire, he says;

STEPHEN
Oh yes sirree Bob, you know I am!
01' Snowball and a certain naked ass
upside down nigger we both know, gonna
have us a big of chat.
He removes the big black poker from the furnaces fire, it's RED HOT END

GLOWS ORANGE.

STEPHEN
Snowballs just makin' sure his talking
stick is all nice and FROSTY.
Ace Woody chuckles to himself as he exits the barn.
Just Stephen with a red hot poker, and naked, bound upside down Django,
alone.
With the red hot poker in his hand Snowball approaches the naked
hanging Django.

STEPHEN
I bet you an' that German thought y'all was
on easy street for awhile - didn't ya?
Y'all track Hildi to the Old Man.
You get the idea to go to Greenville -
look up the Ole Man there.

(BREATH)
That was a good idea. I bet y'all couldn't
believe how easy it was. You meet Moguy, he
buys your horseshit. Ya' git your ass invited
to Candyland, no fuss no muss. Ya' ride the
whole way to the plantation, no one the wiser.
Then ya' ride in to Candyland - ride your
goddamn horses right up to the motherfucking
Big House.









137

STEPHEN

(BEAT)
And that's where you met me. And that's when
you knew your goose was cooked.
He TOUCHES Django's NIPPLE with the ORANGE HOT TIP of the poker.
Unlike a lot of movie hero's, Django doesn't take torture silently and
stoically. This shit fucking hurts, so you best believe he screams his
fucking ass off, and twists in agony when he gets touched by the orange
tip of that red hot poker.

STEPHEN
Now that fancy talkin' white man of yours
didn't know what's what. He still thought his
ass hadda chance. But like the One-Eyed Charly
you are, you always know the end is near
'fore the white folks.
With the ORANGE HOT poker, he BURNS OFF Django's other NIPPLE.
The smell of burned flesh smokes in the air. Stephen makes a show of
breathing it in his nostrils.

STEPHEN
Damn Nigger, you smell good.
He walks behind Django with the poker.

STEPHEN
You know, when you was sittin' on that feather
bed in the quest room in the Big House -
After you slapped my ass to the floor
You were sayin' something 'bout my BARE BLACK
ass, and how you were gonna BUST IT.
Remember that, Bright Boy?
He places the HOT ORANGE END OF THE POKER hard against Django's BARE
buttocks.
Django SCREAMS!
Stephen LAUGHS.
Stephen walks away and sticks the poker back in the fire. He goes
through Django's clothes and pulls out his tan pants. He tosses them on
the floor by the hanging man.

STEPHEN
You leavin', that's what you can take
with you.
Stephen walks over to the hanging upside down man, and as he talks to
him, he begins fondling Django's genitals.









I31

STEPHEN
Now you were quite the topic of conversation
for the last few hours. Seemed like folks
never had a bright idea in their life, was
comin' up with different ways to kill your
ASS. Now most of 'dem ideas involved fuckin
wit your fun parts. But while that might SEEM
like a good idea. Truth is, once ya snip a
niggers nuts, most bleed out. Then I say;
"Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint
Dickey, got it worse then that." Then they're,
"Let's whip 'em to death," "Throw 'em to the
mandingos," "Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs."
And then I say, "What's so special 'bout that?
We do that shit all the time. Hells bells,
the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey got it
worse then that."
He stops massaging Django's balls.

STEPHEN
So Miss Lara got the bright idea of givin'
your ass to The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
And as a slave of The LeQuint Dickey Mining
Company, hence forth, till the day you die,
you will be swinging a sledgehammer, all day,
every day, turning big rocks into little rocks.
And trust me when I tell you it's gonna be
'bout as much fun as it sounds. We sell 'em
the mandingos ain't good for nuttin' no more.
Like them three y'all came back with. For them
big garboons we get twenty a piece. They last
'bout six months. Skinny nigger like you,
I give two or three.
Stephen turns to leave.

DJANGO
Where's Broomhilda?

STEPHEN
She's all right for now. Miss Lara
soft hearted on 'er. She gave her
to Billy Crash. He was sweet on 'er.
Now Billy Crash might not look or
smell too good, but ain't nobody
gonna bother her.
Stephen limps away.

CUT TO









137

EXT - CANDYLAND - AFTERNOON
The Caravan coming from The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company comes riding
up to the plantation. It comes equipped with one CAGE WAGON (from a
prison), ONE white trash PECKAWOOD named FLOYD to drive the wagon, a
2nd white trash PECKAWOOD named ROY to ride lead horse, and a white
trash PECKAWOOD named JANO to bring up the rear riding horses ass, plus
a pack horse that carries dynamite for the mine.
The three peckawoods, who all talk with thick Australian accents, have
stopped the caravan and are having a powwow.

ROY
It's chaos 'round here. Some bastard shot
the big boss. Let's git the niggers and
git out.
The Three mandingos who weren't sold in Greenville, Rodney, Chicken
Charly, and Chester are walked to the wagon by overseers Tommy Giles.
and Broomhilda's new owner Billy Crash. All three slaves carry the
bundles of personal belongings they've had since Greenville. Chester
wears a hat, and Chicken Charly has a corncob pipe in his mouth.
The wagon driver, Floyd, approaches them.

FLOYD
You blacks line up.
They do.

FLOYD
What's your names?

CHESTER
Chester.

CHICKEN CHARLY
Chicken Charly.

RODNEY
Rodney.

FLOYD
I'm.Floyd, this is Roy, and that's Jano.

(POINTING AT

CHESTER'S BUNDLE)
What's that?

CHESTER
It's my stuff.

FLOYD
Throw it in the dirt.









1 40
All three throw their only belongings in the dirt. Floyd takes the'hat
off of Chester's head and sails it away. As well as ripping the
corncob pipe out of Chicken Charly's mouth and tossing it in the dirt.

FLOYD
(to Chicken Charly)
You won't be doin' much smokin' mate.
(to all three)
You are now the property of The LeQuint
Dickey Mining Company. Git in the cage.
This is going to be worse then the three even thought. They climb into
the cage wagon. Floyd locks it behind them.
Roy, the head Aussie, pays Billy Crash for the slaves, when we hear Ace
Woody call out;

ACE WOODY (OS)
Hold on, we got another hammer swinger
for ya.
Ace Woody comes walking out of the barn with Django, shirtless and
barefoot (just like we met him at beginning of the story), wearing his
old tan pants, and his wrists bound by a rope.

ROY
We can't use that skinny bastard.

ACE WOODY
We got an arraignment with Mr.Dickey to take
punishment niggers from time to time.

ROY
No one tole' me 'bout no arraignment.

ACE WOODY
Well if Mr.Dickey ain't takin' you into his
confidence, I'm sure I don't know why.

ROY
Look, no one tole' me 'bout -

ACE WOODY
- No, you look peckawood, this nigger got Boss
Candie killed. And we want his ass punished.
Now I know you need our bucks. So.unless you
wanna ride back to the mine, and tell Mr.Dickey
how and why you fucked up our nice little
business relationship, take this nigger and
hush up about it!

ROY
Fine, stick 'em in the goddamn cage.









"H
Django sees the three mandingos in the cage. They see him too.
Django stops Ace Woody.

DJANGO
Whoa whoa whoa, you can't put me in there
with them. They'll kill me. What about all
that -turning big rocks into little rocks-
shit y'all was. talkin' about? I mean that was
the idea ain't it? You put me in there with
them big ass garboons they kill me on the way.
I mean if that's the idea, that's the idea,
but I didn't think that was the idea.
Ace knows he's right, so he turns to Roy and Floyd.

ACE WOODY
He can't go in there with them.

FLOYD
Why not?

ACE WOODY
They'll kill him.

FLOYD
I don't give a damn.

ACE WOODY
Well we do! He killed the fuckin Boss Man,
we want the mine to grind him to gravel!

ROY
Jano, you're riclin' horses ass, you take this
black and make sure he keeps up.

JANO
Oh, I'll keep 'em up.
Jano takes the rope tired around Django's wrists.and ties the other end
around his saddle horn.
The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company caravan leaves Candyland.

EXT - MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
The Caravan makes its way down a dirt road in pretty Chickasaw County.
Stoic Roy riding lead horse, Floyd driving the cage wagon, Rodney,
Chester, and Chicken Charly bouncing around inside the cage wagon, Jano
riding horses ass, and Django being led on foot behind him.









J42

DJANGO

(TO JANO)
Hey boy!
Jano ignores him.

DJANGO
I said, hey white boy!

JANO
Keep your mouth shut black, you ain't got
nothing to say I wanna hear.

DJANGO
What's he pay you?

JANO
Who?

DJANGO
LeQuint Dickey?

JANO
You gotta few more things to worry about
black boy, then what I get paid.

DJANGO
I ain't worried about it. I'm just curious.
I mean, I'm the property of The LeQuint Dickey
Mining Company, ain't I?

JANO
Yeah.

DJANGO
And you work for The LeQuint Dickey Mining
Company, dont'cha?

JANO
Yeah?

DJANGO
Well, I know how much I'm gettin' paid,
how much you gettin' paid? I mean like
for instance, how much you gettin' paid
for today?

JANO
Look black, it don't work like that. Dickey
paid for our passage from Australia to here.
We get a little money to send back home, and
pay him back for the boat trip.









I"

DJANGO
How long you been here?

JANO
'bout two years.

DJANGO
And you ain't paid him back yet?

JANO

(DEFENSIVELY)
No, not yet!

DJANGO

(LAUGHS)
You a slave too, peckawood. They just bought
your ass for the price of a boat ride.
At least they didn't charge us for our boat
ride ... . ha ha ha ha...

JANO

(YELLING)
You shut up!
Jano's hand grabs his riding crop, and he brings it up to strike
Django, when the black man says to him;

DJANGO
How'd you like to make eleven thousand
dollars?

JANO
What?
Django steps closer to him.

DJANGO
How would you like to make eleven thousand
dollars -- eleven thousand five hundred,
actually?
Roy, in the lead, yells back to Jano;

ROY
Goddamit Jano, stop fuckin with that black,
and keep up!

DJANGO
Keep riding, just ride slower.
They move forward, with Django walking beside Jano on his horse.









R44

DJANGO
Back at that plantation Candyland, there
was an eleven thousand five hundred dollar
fortune just sittin there, and y'all rode
right past it.

JANO
You be damned, blackie. We're not bandits.

DJANGO
That's what's nice about this fortune, it's
not illegal. You can't steal it, ya gotta
earn it.

JANO
If you got something to say, say it.

DJANGO
The eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune
waiting for you back at Candyland, is in the
form of a wanted dead or alive bounty on
Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang.

JANO
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

DJANGO
Smitty Bacall is the leader of a murdering
gang of stagecoach robbers, The Bacall Gang.
There's a seven thousand dollar dead or alive
bounty on him. And one thousand five hundred
dollars for each of his three accomplices,
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and Crazy Craig Koons.
And all four of them gentlemen are sittin back
there at Candyland...laughin their ass off...
cause they just got away with murder.

(BEAT)
But it don't hafta be that way. You and your
mates could get that money.

JANO
Who pays the money?

DJANGO
The Court.

JANO
The Court?

DJANGO
The Austin Texas Courthouse. Oh, and by
the way, the court don't give a damn about
how you kill 'em. You can shoot 'em in the
back, from up on a hill, in the back of
the head, in their sleep - don't matter.

(CON'T)









DJANGO

(CON'T)
Court doesn't care how you do it, just as
long as you do it.

JANO
They.pay us to kill 'em?

DJANGO
No. You kill 'em, and they payyou for the
corpse. Get it?

JANO
I think so... . what did these jokers do again?

DJANGO
Killed innocent people in a stagecoach
robbery. I've got the handbill in my pocket.
Django digs into his tan pants and pulls out the folded up Smitty
Bacall handbill that Dr.Schultz told him to hang on to for good luck.
He hands it to Jano.

JANO
What's this?

DJANGO
I told you, it's the handbill for Smitty
Bacall and The Bacall Gang.
Jano looks at the handbill.

DJANGO
Whatsamatter, can't you read?

JANO
I can read, I just don't have my glasses.
I didn't take 'em with me, because I didn't
think I'd be doin much readin' on a nigger run.

DJANGO
What about that cowboy fella in the lead?

JANO
Roy?

DJANGO
Can Roy read?

JANO
Look, get it straight black, I can fuckin
read. I just don't got my glasses.

EXT -- BEAUTIFUL MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY TABLEAUX at DUSK
The LeQuint Dickey Mining Co. Caravan has stopped, and pulled over to
the side of the road.

IN THE CAGE
Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester sit in the cage, and watch through
the bars this new turn of events without any.clear comprehension of
what they're watching.
What the three caged men are watching is the three Australian mining
company employees and Django, off in the distance (where they can't
hear what they're saying), having some sort of a discussion. That
includes the still bound by the wrists Django showing the three men a
piece of paper.

INSERT: SMITTY BACALL'S WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE HANDBILL
Roy holds it in his hand as he reads and Django talks.

DJANGO
I ain't no goddamn slave. Do I sound-like
a fuckin slave? I'm a bounty hunter.
Yesterday as a free man, I rode into
Candyland on a horse with my white German
partner, Dr.King Schultz. We'd tracked The
Bacall Gang from Texas all the way to
Chickasaw County. Found them laying low at
Candyland. We went in to get 'em, things
went sour. My partner was killed, and Calvin
Candie was shot. Everybody there decided to
blame me, so here I am.

(TO ROY)
You know I'm not on the manifest? All of you
know I'm not suppose to be on this trip.
But those four men, are still back there.
They're still wanted. And that eleven thousand
five hundred is still up for grabs. And the
last thing they'd expect is y'all rid.in back
and gittin it.
Django is damn convincing.

ROY
What's your deal? You tell us who they are
and we let ya go?

DJANGO
I ain't tellin' who they are. But, you give
me a pistol, and a horse, and five hundred
dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred,
and I'll point 'em out to you.
He's got these greedy sonsabitches right on the hook...he just needs
one little push.









1Q7

DJANGO
Y'all wanna ask somebody if I'm tellin the
truth, ask them mandingos. You can't put
me in the same cage with them without them
killin me. Why ya think that is? Ask them
.am I a Candyland slave, or did I ride in
there on a horse, with a white man, yesterday?

CUT TO

ROY AND FLOYD
go to the Cage Wagon to talk with the three mandingos. As they walk,
Roy continues to study the handbill.

ROY

(READING ALOUD)
"Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
The Bacall Gang. For murder and stagecoach
robbery. Seven thousand dollars for Bacall.
One thousand five hundred dollars for each
of his gang members... ." This is a real handbill.

FLOYD
Just because the handbill's real doesn't
mean that other bunch of malarky.is.

ROY
Why would a nigger slave have a wanted dead
or alive handbill in his pocket?
Floyd doesn't have an answer for that one.

ROY
That black's damn convincing.
They get to The Cage O'Men. Roy startles them with a direct question;

ROY
(pointing, behind
him, at Django)
That black ride into Candyland yesterday?
The Caged Men don't know what they're suppose to say.
Roy removes the pistol from his belt, cocks back the hammer and points
the barrel at the cage.

ROY
I'm gonna ask again, and remember I don't
like liars. Is he a Candyland slave, or did
he ride in with a white man yesterday?









CHESTER
Yeah. They walked us from the Greenville
Auction and he rode on a horse with a
white man.

ROY
This white man, was the black his slave?

RODNEY
He weren't no slave.

FLOYD
You sure about that?

RODNEY
Damn sure.
Roy starts taking the possibility of an eleven thousand dollar windfall
seriously.

ROY
What happened at Candyland?

CHICKEN CHARLY
Bunch of shootin, master got shot.

ROY
Who shot 'em?

CHICKEN CHARLY
The German.

ROY
And why did he do that?

CHICKEN CHARLY
The nigger and the German were actin as if they
were slavers, but they weren't.

ROY
What were they?

RODNEY
Bounty hunters.
Floyd is starting to get convinced.

FLOYD
Goddamn Roy, this could be big.
(to the Slaves)
Do you know who Smitty Bacall is?









!Y,

ROY
(barking at Floyd)
They wouldn't go by their outlaw names
you idiot!

CUT TO
Roy and Floyd walk back to Django and Jano.

ROY
Okay black, you gotta deal.
Jano reacts.

DJANGO
I got one more condition.

ROY
What?

DJANGO
When we get there, when the time comes,
you let me help you kill 'em.
Roy whips out a big knife, and cuts the rope around Django's wrists.

ROY

(LAUGHING)
You got a deal, black.
Django interrupts -

DJANGO
You gotta deal, mate.
Roy really laughs this time. As does Django and the other two Aussies.

ROY
You're all right for a black fella!

THE CAGE
Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester watch the sight of the white men
cutting the ropes that bound the black man's wrists, as well as them
all sharing a laugh, with wonderment. "Who is this Nigger?"

BACK WITH THE LAUGHING QUARTET

ROY
We'll give you that pack horse.

DJANGO
What's them saddle bags filled with?

FLOYD
Dynamite.








!so

DJANGO
I.ain't ridin no horse with no goddamn
dynamite on his back!

ROY

(CHUCKLE CHUCKLE)
Yeah, I can see why. Jano take those sticks
off that horse, and stick 'em in the nigger
cage.
Jano does this, lifting two out of four bags filled with dynamite off
the pack horse, and walking to the cage wagon, unlocking ' the cage door,
and placing the bags inside. The Black Men in the cage don't like this
at all.
Jano removes the last of the dynamite filled saddle bags from Django's
horse, throws them over his shoulders, and begins walking back to The
Cage Wagon.
Django moves to his new pack horse, and says;

DJANGO
Where's my pistol?

ROY
Floyd, you got that rifle on the wagon, give
'em your gun and your belt.
Floyd unbuckles his gun belt, gun and all, folds it up, and walks over
to Django handing it to him. Django accepts it.
About the pistol, Floyd tells Django;

FLOYD
Now don't drop it now. I just had the sights
fixed last month, it's perfect.
Django holding the gunbelt in his hand.

DJANGO
That's good to know.
Without taking the pistol out of the gunbelt, DJANGO SHOOTS FLOYD TWICE
in the chest...
Roy turns around...
Django takes the gun out of the holster...
. BAM...ROY is HIT in the UPPER BRAIN AREA and falls to the grass
dead.
Jano goes for the gun on his hip.
Django SHOOTS ONE OF THE SADDLE BAGS over.Jano's shoulder...KAHBOOM!!!!!








Jano is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS...
The KAHBOOM knocks Django on his ass...
The CAGE WAGON
Rodney, Chester, and Chicken Charlie come down from the shock of the
blast. The image outside the bars of their cage is of DUST and SMOKE in
the air, obscuring all visibility...

THEN ...
A sudden GUST OF WIND comes and BLOWS all the smoke and dust away,
REVEALING in bright color focus...
.DJANGO standing among the two dead Aussies, and whatever is left of
Jano.
He's shoeless and shirtless, but Floyd's pistol and gunbelt sit
wrapped around his waist.
He locks eyes with the three men in the cage..
He then moves towards the wagon, and unhooks the mine company beast,
and climbs aboard him bareback.
He leans over and snatches the RIFLE that Floyd kept on the wagon seat
next to him.
Grabbing a fistful of the horses mane, he digs his heels into the
beast's side. The pack animals SPRINGS TO LIFE under the new rider. By
now it should be apparent that Django brings the best out of horses, and
horses bring the best out of Django.
From his high horse Django looks down at The Three Caged Men...

.THEN...
Using the rifle in a QUICK ONE HANDED MOVE he SHOOTS the lock on the
cage door.
He looks at the three men, especially Rodney, then says;

DJANGO
Throw up that dynamite.
Rodney grabs a saddle bag full of dynamite and tosses it to Django on
his Horse.
Django wraps it around the Horse's neck, turns the beast around, and
without saying another word, rides back in the direction of Candyland.
The Three NOW FREE Mandingos, watch him ride away.
"Who was that nigger?"

A GORGEOUS BIG SKY SOUTHERN PURPLE AND ORANGE SUNSET WE PAN DOWN from
the sky and see in small black silhouette the Funeral Procession of
Calvin Candie carrying the Coffin of the former Master up the hill on
'Candyland that leads to the Graveyard.
A WHITE PREACHER walks out in front of the Procession.
Then comes Calvin Candie's Coffin carried by eight pallbearers,
Stephen, Moguy, Bartholomew, Ace Woody, Brown, Cody, and his best
mandingos SAMSON and GOLDIE.
The first mourner in line is Lara Lee dressed in a fancy black dress,
wide brim black hat, black veil, and ever present black Mammy (Cora)
crying at her side.

CORA
The sky's real pretty Miss Lara. Monsieur
Candie think it real nice.

LARA LEE
Ah, bless you sweet innocent Cora.

WE CROSS CUT WITH SHOTS
of Django RIDING THE HORSE on the way back to Candyland. The bare
backed black man riding the horse bareback, holding the RIFLE in one
hand, a fistful of the horses mane in the other, hauling ass against a
gorgeous SUNSET SKY, looks like an Indian.

EXT - TRACKER SHACK/BUNKHOUSE - SUNSET
The same GORGEOUS SUNSET SKY over the same shitty Tracker shack
-Bunkhouse that Mr.Stonesipher and his three obscure companions share.
The GERMAN SHEPHERDS (including Marsha) rest in the chicken wire kennel
next to the bunkhouse.

INT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET
The FOUR TRACKERS are.missing the funeral, hanging out in the bunkhouse
wearing their beards. Mr.Stonesipher, Lex, and Stew are playing a
mountain card game which looks like poker, except the way you get rid of
your cards is different. Instead of chips they play with, "NIGGER EARS"
(yes, the ears of slaves). On a second viewing the audience may notice
that some of the slaves at Candyland are missing one ear.
Jake, the biggest, is off by himself, pounding nails into a small
delicate BIRDHOUSE he's making.

EXT - WOODS-OUTSIDE THE SHACK - SUNSET
INSERT: HORSE HOOFS walking then stopping. Django's bare feet jump on
to the ground.

INT - DOG KENNEL - SUNSET
The FOUR DOGS lay out... . when, Marsha hears something, and raises her
head...

SHIRTLESS DJANGO
moves quietly through the woods.

MARSHA
rises to all fours, to listen and smell. out in the darkness, her three
PALS continue to lay out.

DJANGO BY A TREE
he can see the bunkhouse entrance, the LONG HANDLE AXE buried in the
chopping block, the kennel, and the one dog looking his way.

MARSHA

BARK!
The Other Three Dogs wake up, and go on alert.
Django disappears.

INT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET
They hear the barking inside.
Mr.STONESIPHER
Jake!
Jake building his birdhouse.

JAKE
Yeah?
Mr.STONESIPHER
Check on Marsha.
Jake, the one not playing the game, puts aside his hammer, and rises to
check on them (these guys are very sensitive about their dogs).

EXT - TRACKER SHACK
As the BARKING gets louder, WE SEE A CLOSE UP of The Axe in the
chopping block, and Django's hand REMOVING IT.

JAKE
opens the bunkhouse door-he sees directly a hundred feet in front of
him, Django standing there with the axe. Just as he reacts...

DJANGO ... . THROWS THE AXE...

JAKE ... . IT HITS HIM IN THE FACE.








After letting go of the axe handle, Django RUNS FULL SPEED toward Jake.
Before the other three have really registered what's happening, Django
has crossed the distance, and is YANKING The Axe out of JAKE'S FACE.
And with AXE in hand, Django chases and fights with all three trackers,
till after a point where he's CHOPPED DOWN TWO OF THEM, Lex, and Stew,
and now there's only Mr.Stonesipher left.
But Mr.Stonesipher has managed to draw his gigantic BUCK KNIFE, and is
able to fight back against Django. You know Stonesipher's great with a
knife, plus his fighting style is like one of his dogs, attack attack
attack.
Django uses the axe handle in a defensive position.
The expert Mountain Boy begins SCORING BLADE CUTS on shirtless Django.
The two men fight until they end up losing their weapons. Then it's
just a fight of brute strength, and survival. Mr.Stonesipher is
physically bigger then Django. But if Django's going to save Broomhilda,
not to mention get revenge on all these Candyland motherfuckers, he has
to take Stonesipher's ass out.
This Black Man who has been under the yoke of white man's domination
all his life, and this White Man who feeds black people to dogs, fight
each other for their life.
Django gets his arm around Stonesipher's neck in a headlock, but the
mountain boy is big enough to lift Django. So like a rodeo rider
holding onto bull for dear life, Django tightens his lock around his
opponents neck. Django gets his hand on the HAMMER Jake was building
the birdhouse with, and BRINGS IT CRASHING DOWN ON THE TOP OF

STONESIPHER'S HEAD.
That weakens Stonesipher.
He HITS HIM AGAIN IN THE HEAD.
That drops Stonesipher to his knees.
He HITS HIM AGAIN WITH THE HAMMER ON THE HEAD.
That puts the mountain man down on his back.
He HITS HIM ONE MORE TIME WITH THE HAMMER TO keep him down for good.
The Trackers are all dead.
Only the dogs mad barking remains.
EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT
The Funeral for Calvin Candie is underway. The Preacher reads some
words over him.









EXT - TRACKER SHACK - NIGHT
Django, half naked, splattered with blood from the axe murders, steps
out of the shack. He takes a wash basin off the window sill, and walks
over to the WATER PUMP.
Marsha and her three friends-continue to BARK like mad.
He PUMPS a couple of times, and water explodes into the bowl. He
begins washing the blood-off'of himself. As he washes, he says outloud;

DJANGO
What ya doin around here, boy?
Timmy steps from his watching place in the bushes.

TIMMY
I was just walkin' by.

DJANGO
Wanna help me out?

TIMMY
Sure.

DJANGO
My woman, Hildi, is with Billy Crash.
You know where his shack is?

TIMMY
Sure do.

DJANGO
You show me?

TIMMY
Will I get in trouble?

DJANGO
Not by the time I get through killin'
everybody.
Timmy has never heard a black man talk like that. He believes him.

TIMMY
I'll show ya.

THEN ...
Django turns towards the barking dogs. He turns back to Timmy and asks;

DJANGO
You know what toadstools look like?









15-C

TIMMY
Sure do.

DJANGO
Go pick me a mess of 'em.
INSERT: TIMMY picking TOADSTOOLS (POISON MUSHROMS).
INSERT: DJANGO stirring a big pot of BEEF STEW with a wooden spoon in
the tracker shack.
Timmy comes'in carrying a bunch of toadstools inside his shirt.
Django takes the toadstools and Mr.Stonesipher's BUCK KNIFE and CHOPS
the mushrooms into tiny pieces.
He tosses the tiny bits of poisoned shrooms into the beefy sauce, and
mixes it up with the spoon.

EXT - MARSHA'S KENNEL - NIGHT
Django throws the pot of poisoned beef stew over the top of the kennel.
It lands on the ground with a PLOP.
The Angry Dogs, are nevertheless', still dogs, and greedily scarf up
the stew.
Django watches them wolf down their ultimate agony with a smile.

DJANGO
You bit your last nigger, bitch? Bite on that.
Django lifts Timmy up on to the bare backed wagon horse.

DJANGO
First things first, boy. Take me to my horse.

EXT - FUNERAL NIGHT
The funeral is in full melodramatic bore.

TNT - STABLE-BLACKSMITH - NIGHT
Timmy brings Django to the stable on the Candyland grounds. Django goes
straight up to the stall housing Tony and says hello. Tony's happy to
see him. Django feeds him an apple he picked along the way for him.
He turns and sees the body of Dr.Schultz lying in a heap.
And Schultz's horse Fritz in the stable.

DJANGO
Saddle up Fritz and Tony.








Timmy just stares.

DJANGO
Now, boy!
Timmy hops to work.
Django bends down over the body of Dr.Schultz, he takes Broomhilda's
bill of sale and freedom papers out of his back pocket. He also
searches for and finds Schultz's hidden DERRINGER, he keeps it in a
holster around his ankle.
As Timmy saddles the horses, he asks;

TIMMY
Do you feel bad for your friend?
Django rises from the body of his friend.

DJANGO
Yeah, "I do.
As Timmy saddles the horses he says;

TIMMY
I know just how ya feel. I lost a white
friend once. He drowned in the lake.
Django doesn't correct the difference between Dr.Schultz and a white
friend, because there's nothing he could say to Timmy to make him
understand.
He goes over to his pile of clothes, which still lie next to the
furnace. He Puts on his boots. His Green Jacket over his bare chest.
And finally his hat.
EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT
The service is over, everybody is hugging each other and holding hands,
and beginning to leave.

INT - BILLY CRASH'S SHACK - NIGHT
Billy Crash is in bed fucking Broomhilda. She doesn't wail, she doesn't
make any whimpering sounds, but her eyes constantly water.
As Billy's fucking her he says;

BILLY CRASH
It's gonna be real nice 'round here now
the 'ol man's gone.

He stops fucking in frustration

BROOMHILDA
I can't.

BILLY CRASH
Now girl, I'm tryin' to be nice.

BROOMHILDA
I can't help it! I'm really sad!
He hops off her and yells at her.

BILLY CRASH
Well goddamit, you're a nigger! Life is sad
for niggers! Git use to it!

(CALMING DOWN)
Look you know Me, Hildi. I'm an ass buster
from way back. But you know I've always been
sweet on you. I don't wanna bust your ass.
So don't make me! Now I'm gonna go shit.
You calm down.
He exits the shack to go the outhouse, leaving Broomhilda alone.
WE MOVE INTO A CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA lying on the bed. She cries for
Django, she cries for herself...

.THEN...
She HEARS an IMPACT SOUND, and a MUFFLED "Ooomph" SOUND.
And through the spaces in the wooden planks that act as walls in Billy
Crash's shack, she sees a figure fall to the ground.
Then she sees another figure through the wooden planks move towards the
front door.

CU BROOMHILDA
Her face, stained with tears, watches the door.
A soft "Knock Knock" on the door.

BROOMHILDA

(SOFTLY)
Yes?
The VOICE on the other side of the door, says;

DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
Hey Little Trouble Maker.

She hops out of bed, and throws open the door...

THERE HE IS,
she runs into his arms.
EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT
The TWO OLD SLAVE.GRAVE DIGGERS are throwing the first shovelfuls of
dirt on Monsieur Calvin J. Candie's coffin.
The participants of this ritual, begin to move away from the grave. The
funeral is a private affair, just the Candie Family Unit, some of the
overseers, and the slaves. No one from town, except the Preacher.
The SLAVE MOURNERS begin. to move towards their living area, all saying
goodbye to Miss Lara. Miss Lara makes a big show of saying goodbye to
them.
A little cognizant of the Candie Family unit begin the walk off the
hill back to the big house.

EXT - BILLY CRASH'S SHACK - NIGHT
Django with Broomhilda. Billy Crash lies dead in the B.G., Stonesipher's
Buck Knife buried deep in his chest. He hands Broomhilda her papers.

DJANGO
Here's your bill of sale, and freedom papers.
No matter what happens to me, hold on to these
and get out of the south.

BROOMHILDA
What's gonna happen to you?

DJANGO
Ain't nuttin' gonna happen to me honey,
I'm just sayin'. Now go to the stable, little
Timmy's got our horses .saddled. Your horse is
named Fritz. He's a damn fine horse. Meet me
around the side of the big house.

BROOMHILDA
But what about you -

DJANGO
- Don't worry about me. I'll see you, with
Timmy and the horses, by the big house.
He sends her on her way.
Django looks up and sees the silhouettes of the funeral party walking
down hill heading back for the big house.

EXT - The TRAIL BACK TO The BIG HOUSE - NIGHT
The Family unit of The Late Calvin Candie and his sister Lara Lee walk
back to The Big House for a drink. This Candie Family Unit consists of:
LARA LEE (unarmed) in her black flowing funeral dress.
CORA (unarmed) her mammy, walks with Miss Lara, holding her hand.
STEPHEN. (unarmed) dressed in his fancy black velvet version of his
normal House Nigger outfit, walks on the other side of his mistress
Miss Lara, holding her other hand.
ACE WOODY (armed with a gun belt.around his hip) dressed in his Wyatt
Earp like funeral black suit, with the string tie, walks by himself.
LEONIDE MOGUY (armed with a gun belt around his hip) walks by himself.
BARTHOLOMEW (unarmed) dressed in his tight fitting business suit, with
his hat, walks alone.
BROWN and JINGLE BELLS CODY (both armed with guns on their hips) both
dressed slightly like cowboy peacocks, walk together.
and finally,
SAMSON and GOLDIE (unarmed) Calvin Candie's two prized mandingos,
wearing suits they borrowed from Bartholomew..
This CANDIE FAMILY UNIT walk to The Big House for a few post funeral
drinks.
They enter the lawn in front of The Big House, and head for the front
door.
Broomhilda on Fritz and Timmy riding on Tony come along the side of the
property by some shed. They see The Candie Family Unit, all dressed in
their darkest finery, walking towards the front steps of The Big House.
The woman and little boy stop. But the group of enemies aren't looking
their way.
The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
moves closer towards the front of The Big House...

WHEN ...
The front of The Big House

EXPLODES!
knocking the.Candie Family Unit flat on their collective asses.
BROOMHILDA and TIMMY
can't believe their eyes.









I6 I

WOOD - STONE - PLASTER - DIRT - DUST - GLASS - SMOKE - GUNPOWDER
hang in the air.
The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
starts coming to their senses. Nobody was killed, or even seriously
hurt (unless you count eardrums), just stunned.
As their minds try and grasp with what just happened, their eyes look
up from the ground, and try and see through the smoke and dust.
The'SMOKE and DUST thins a little, and we see inside the smoke the
mansion has been obliterated, but The Big House front steps remain.
CUE cool MUSIC.
STEPHEN sees something in the smoke, squints.
ACE WOODY sees something in the smoke, squints.
BROWN and CODY see something in the smoke, squint.
In the SMOKE and DUST we begin to see a FIGURE, walking towards them.
ACE WOODY squints at the FIGURE.
MOGUY sees the.FIGURE.
CORA attending to Miss Lara sees the FIGURE, then MISS LARA sees it.
The FIGURE moves further out of the SMOKE and DUST.
ACE WOODY, on the ground, his hand starts to move towards the gun
around his waist.
Then he sees The FIGURE.is carrying something in his left hand...
.it's Floyd's Winchester, he raises it, and points it at Ace.
ACE WOODY's hand moves away from his gun.
The FIGURE steps out of the SMOKE. It's DJANGO dressed in his DJANGO

OUTFIT.
STEPHEN, ACE WOODY, MOGUY, LARA LEE, BARTHOLOMEW, CORA, BROWN and
JINGLE BELLS CODY, SAMPSON or GOLDIE...Nobody can believe Django's
standing there.
He stands at the top of the front steps of The Big House, looking down
at The Candie Family Unit, all lying on the front lawn, Winchester
rifle held casually in his left hand. His right hand held casually by
the gun on his hip.
The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
all on their ass in the grass, look up at Django with a mixture of
Wonder, Fear, and Hate.









ICZ

WE MOVE INTO A ROMANTIC CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA
as she watches this.
As DJANGO looks out at the ten stunned enemies spread out on The Big
House front lawn,. and as they look back from the grass at him.
The black man in the cool green jacket says;

DJANGO
I bet I.know what you're thinkin', Ace Woody?
You'.re thinkin', why didn't I'cut off that
niggers nuts when .1 had the'chance? Right?

ACE WOODY
I guess I shoulda'.

DJANGO
Yes you should of.
He points the Winchester at the people spread out on the grass.

DJANGO
Everybody stand up!
It's now Django who gives the orders. They stand up quickly.
Django, with the rifle pointing at them, just looks at The Candie
Family Unit. Enjoying their collective hatred.

THEN...
He tosses the rifle away.
Then moves his right hand by his gun belt in his holster, as he takes a

SHOWDOWN STANCE.
EVERYBODY realizes DJANGO's intentions.
Even BROOMHILDA and TIMMY.
DJANGO looks down from his position at the top of The Big House steps
at the ten people, and says;

DJANGO
All black folks, take ten steps away from
the white folks.
DJANGO's eyes go to STEPHEN, who looks back at him.

DJANGO
Not you Stephen. You're right where you
belong.









163
The Black Folks, Cora, Bartholomew, Samson, and Goldie begin taking ten
steps away from the White Folks and the gunfight.
LARA LEE can't believe Cora's leaving her.
CORA is "I'm sorry Miss Lara, but I never did nuttin' to that nigger."
DJANGO looks to STEPHEN, and takes Schultz's hidden Derringer out of
his pocket.

DJANGO

(TO STEPHEN)
Let's see if you can handle this as well
as you can my nuts?
He tosses the Ole Man the tiny gun.

DJANGO

(TO EVERYBODY)
Somebody give Miss Lara a gun.
BROWN gives LARA LEE one. of his two guns.

BROWN

(TO DJANGO)
Can I at least cock it for her?

DJANGO
Yep.
BROWN cocks back the hammer of the peacemaker, and puts it in her hand,
and points it towards the ground.

BROWN
(to Lara Lee)
Okay Miss Lara, keep it pointed down till
the shootin' starts. Then bring it up as
fast as you can.
LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLI can't come to grips with what she's.in the
middle of, who she's facing, what's in her hand, or what's about to
happen.

DJANGO
(to the six)
Make your play hillbillies.
The MUSIC SWELLS.









16'F
EVERYBODY, except for LARA LEE is READY:

DJANGO ACE WOODY

STEPHEN MOGUY

BROWN CODY

LARA LEE
The PEOPLE watching on the side:

BARTHOLOMEW SAMSON BROOMHILDA

CORA GOLDIE TIMMY
EVERYONE'S ready, but no one wants to start this party...

TILL...
ACE WOODY starts to go for the gun in his holster, and STEPHEN starts
to raise his Derringer.
But it's no contest.
As soon as Django saw any movement from the six in front of him,
Floyd's Pistol was QUICKSILVER FAST in. his right hand, as his left hand
FANNED the Pistols Hammer, SHOOTING INSTANTLY all five White People (and
Stephen) standing in front of him.
They all fall to grass in different ways..
It was never any contest, they and WE (the audience) just didn't know
HOW GOOD DJANGO was.

FLASH ON
DJANGO showing off his incredible FAST DRAW and ACCURATE MARKSMANSHIP
to Dr.Schultz.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(SMILING)
You know what they're going to call you,
my boy? "The fastest gun in the South."

BACK TO SHOWDOWN
DJANGO stands on the top steps of what's left of'The Big House, looking
down at The Candie Family Unit, who all lay dead or dying on the
Candyland front lawn.
The WITNESSES can't fathom what they'just witnessed.









/65
All the CANDIE FAMILY UNIT lies on the grass SHOT. But some are still
alive. We HEAR MOANING coming from LARA LEE, CODY, and MOGUY.
DJANGO sees this.
The Black Man reaches behind him and comes out with a DYNAMITE STICK.
He tosses it on the grass among the bodies.
He takes aim with his pistol; and FIRES.
It EXPLODES.
Finishing off what was left of the Candie Family Unit, not to mention,
blowing the limbs off of many of them.
The LAWN is SILENT.
DJANGO'S PISTOL goes back in its holster.
Django walks down the front steps of The Big House, feeling tremendous
satisfaction in the wrath he just wroth on Candie and Co.
He removes Dr.Schultz's tiny Derringer from Stephen's dead hand,
putting it in his pocket. Then heads over to where Broomhilda and Timmy
wait for him with Fritz and Tony.
As he,walks up to Broomhilda on Fritz, he says;

DJANGO
Hey Little Trouble Maker.

BROOMHILDA
Hey Big Trouble Maker.

DJANGO
Down, boy.
Timmy hops off of Tony.
Django climbs aboard Tony. He says to Broomhilda;

DJANGO
I tole' you ain't nuttin' gonna happen
to me.

BROOMHILDA
Yes you did.

DJANGO
Girl, you're gonna hafta start trustin' me.

BROOMHILDA
I'll keep that in mind.









Â–º66
Django looks down to Timmy.

DJANGO
Thanks for the help, boy.
He reaches into his saddle bag, and pulls out an apple, and tosses it
down to Timmy.

DJANGO
That's for you. Good luck Tim.
(he points to
the Northern Sky)
The North star, is that one.
He looks to Broomhilda on Fritz.

DJANGO
You gonna hafta keep up, ya know?

BROOMHILDA
You won't wait for me.

DJANGO
Better not.

BROOMHILDA
You won't.

DJANGO

(SMILING)
Better not.

BROOMHILDA

(SMILING)
You won't.
They kiss.
Then, astride Tony, Django leaves Candyland having rescued his
Broomhilda from her Mountain, her Ring of Hellfire, and all her
Dragons.
EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY

The modest dairy farm in the countryside of Nancy, France (what the French call cow country).

We read a SUBTITLE in the sky above the farmhouse:

CHAPTER ONE:

“ONCE UPON A TIME IN . . .

NAZI-OCCUPIED FRANCE”

This SUBTITLE disappears and is replaced by another one:

“1941

One year into the German

occupation of France”

The farm consists of a house, a small barn, and twelve cows spread about.

The owner of the property, a bull of a man, FRENCH FARMER, brings an ax up and down on a tree stump, blemishing his property. However, simply by sight, you’d never know if he’s been beating at this stump for the last year or just started today.

JULIE:

one of his three pretty teenage daughters, is hanging laundry on the clothesline. As she hangs up a white bedsheet, she hears a noise. Moving the sheet aside, she sees:

JULIE’S POV

A Nazi town car convertible, with two little Nazi flags attached to the hood, a NAZI SOLDIER behind the wheel, a NAZI OFFICER alone in the backseat, following TWO OTHER NAZI SOLDIERS on motorcycles, coming up over the hill on the country road leading to their farm.

JULIE:

Pappa.

The French farmer sinks his ax in the stump, looks over his shoulder, and sees the Germans approaching.

The FARMER’S WIFE, CHARLOTTE, comes to the doorway of their home, followed by her TWO OTHER TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, and sees the Germans approaching.

The farmer yells to his family in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

FARMER:

Go back inside and shut the door.

FARMER:

(to Julie)

Julie, get me some water from the pump to wash up with, then get inside with your mother.

The young lady runs to the water pump by the house. She picks up a basin and begins pumping. After a few pumps, water comes out, splashing into the basin.

The French farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping away at, pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from his face, and waits for the Nazi convoy to arrive. After living for a year with the sword of Damocles suspended over his head, this may very well be the end.

Julie finishes filling the water basin and places it on the windowsill.

JULIE:

Ready, Pappa.

FARMER:

Thank you, darling, now go inside and take care of your mother. Don’t run.

Julie walks inside the farmhouse and closes the door behind her.

As her father stands up from the stump and moves over to the windowsill with the water basin . . .

. . . The SOUND OF THE ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get

LOUDER.

The farmer SPLASHES water from the basin on his face and down his front. He takes a towel off a nail and wipes the excess water from his face and chest, as he watches the two motorcycles, the one automobile, and the four representatives of the National Socialist Party come to a halt on his property.

We don’t move into them but keep observing them from a distance, like the farmer.

The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLISTS are off their bikes and standing at attention next to them.

The NAZI DRIVER has walked around the automobile and opened the door for his superior.

The NAZI OFFICER says to the driver in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN:

NAZI OFFICER:

This is the property of Perrier LaPadite?

NAZI DRIVER:

Yes, Herr Colonel.

The Nazi officer climbs out of the backseat of the vehicle, carrying in his left hand a black leather attaché case.

NAZI OFFICER:

Herrman, until I summon you, I am to be left alone.

NAZI DRIVER:

As you wish, Herr Colonel.

The S.S. colonel yells to the farmer in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

NAZI OFFICER:

Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?

FARMER:

I am Perrier LaPadite.

The S.S. colonel crosses the distance between them with long strides and says, in French, with a smile on his face:

NAZI OFFICER:

It is a pleasure to meet you, Monsieur LaPadite. I am Colonel Hans Landa of the S.S.

COL. HANS LANDA offers the French farmer, PERRIER LAPADITE, his hand. The Frenchman takes the German hand in his and shakes it.

PERRIER:

How may I help you?

COL. LANDA

I was hoping you could invite me inside your home and we may have a discussion.

INT—LAPADITE FARMHOUSE—DAY

The door to the farmhouse swings open, and the farmer gestures for the S.S. colonel to enter. Removing his gray S.S. cap, the German steps inside the Frenchman’s home.

Col. Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the farmer’s wife and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen, smiling in his direction.

The farmer enters behind him, closing the door.

PERRIER:

Colonel Landa, this is my family.

The S.S. colonel clicks his heels together and takes the hand of the French farmer’s wife . . .

COL. LANDA

Col. Hans Landa of the S.S., Madame, at your service.

He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his hostess’s hand . . .

COL. LANDA

Please excuse my rude intrusion on your routine.

FARMER’S WIFE

Don’t be ridiculous, Herr Colonel.

While still holding the French woman’s hand and looking into her eyes, the S.S. colonel says:

COL. LANDA

Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have heard in the village about your family are all true. Your wife is a beautiful woman.

His eyes leave the mother and move to the three daughters.

COL. LANDA

(CON’T)

And each of your daughters is more lovely than the last.

PERRIER:

Merci. Please have a seat.

The farmer offers the S.S. colonel a seat at the family’s wooden dinner table. The Nazi officer accepts the French farmer’s offer and lowers himself into the chair, placing his gray S.S. cap on the table and keeping his black attaché case on the floor by his feet.

The farmer (perfect host) turns to his wife and says:

PERRIER:

Charlotte, would you be so good as to get the

Colonel some wine?

COL. LANDA

Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine. This being a dairy farm, one would be safe in assuming you have milk?

CHARLOTTE:

Oui.

COL. LANDA

Then milk is what I prefer.

CHARLOTTE:

Very well.

The mother of three takes a carafe of milk out of the icebox

and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for the colonel.

The S.S. colonel takes a long drink from the glass, then puts it down LOUDLY on the wooden table.

COL. LANDA

Monsieur, to both your family and your cows I say: Bravo.

PERRIER:

Merci.

COL. LANDA

Please, join me at your table.

PERRIER:

Very well.

The French farmer sits at his wooden dinner table across from the Nazi.

The women remain standing.

Col. Landa leans forward and says to the farmer in a low tone of confidentiality:

COL. LANDA

Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to discuss would be better discussed in private. You’ll notice, I left my men outdoors. If it wouldn’t offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside?

PERRIER:

You are right.

PERRIER:

(to his women)

Charlotte, would you take the girls outside. The Colonel and I need to have a few words.

The farmer’s wife follows her husband’s orders and gathers her daughters, taking them outside, closing the door behind them.

The two men are alone at the farmer’s dinner table, in the farmer’s humble home.

COL. LANDA

Monsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform you I’ve exhausted the extent of my French. To continue to speak it so inadequately would only serve to embarrass me. However, I’ve been led

to believe you speak English quite well?

PERRIER:

Oui.

COL. LANDA

Well, it just so happens, I do as well. This being your house, I ask your permission to switch to English for the remainder of the conversation.

PERRIER:

By all means.

They now speak ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA

Monsieur LaPadite, while I’m very familiar with you and your family,

I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am. Are you aware

of my existence?

The farmer answers:

PERRIER:

Yes.

COL. LANDA

This is good. Are you aware of the job I’ve been ordered to carry out in France?

PERRIER:

Yes.

The colonel drinks more milk.

COL. LANDA

Please tell me what you’ve heard?

PERRIER:

I’ve heard the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for gentile.

The S.S. colonel smiles.

COL. LANDA

The Führer couldn’t have said it better himself.

PERRIER:

But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.

The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.

COL. LANDA

I’m aware of that. I read the report on this area. But like any enterprise,

when under new management, there’s always a slight duplication of efforts. Most of it being a complete waste of time, but it needs to be done nevertheless.

I just have a few questions, Monsieur LaPadite. If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the

file on your family.

Taking his black leather attaché case and placing it on the table, he takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts an expensive black fountain pen from his uniform’s front pocket. Opening the folder and referring to it:

COL. LANDA

Now, before the occupation there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself:

the Loveitts, the Doleracs, the Rollins, and the Dreyfuses, is that correct?

PERRIER:

To my knowledge those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.

Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?

Looking up from his papers:

COL. LANDA

Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your house.

Make yourself comfortable.

The farmer gets up from the table, goes to a shelf over the fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the fixings to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi guest.

As the farmer loads the bowl of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S. colonel studies the papers in front of him.

COL. LANDA

Now, according to these papers, all

the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for—except the Dreyfuses. Somewhere in the last year it would appear they have vanished.

Which leads me to the conclusion that they’ve either made good their escape

or someone is very successful hiding them. (looking up from

his papers, across the table at the farmer)

What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, Monsieur LaPadite?

PERRIER:

Only rumors—

COL. LANDA

—I love rumors! Facts can be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing. So, Monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding

the Dreyfuses?

The farmer looks at Landa.

COL. LANDA

Speak freely, Monsieur LaPadite, I want to hear what the rumors are, not who told them to you.

The farmer puffs thoroughly on his pipe.

PERRIER:

Again, this is just a rumor—but we

heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.

COL. LANDA

So the rumors you’ve heard have been of escape?

PERRIER:

Yes.

COL. LANDA

Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfuses friendly?

As the farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind his chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the floorboards, revealing:

FIVE HUMAN BEINGS

lying horizontally underneath the farmer’s floorboards. These human beings are the DREYFUSES, who have lived lying down underneath the dairy farmer’s house for the past year. But one couldn’t call what the Dreyfuses have done for the last year living. This family has done the only thing they could—hide from an occupying army that wishes to exterminate them.

PERRIER:

We were families in the same community, in the same business. I wouldn’t say

we were friends, but members of the same community. We had common interests.

The S.S. colonel takes in this answer, seems to accept it, then moves to the next question.

COL. LANDA

Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?

PERRIER:

There were five of them.

The father, Jacob . . . wife, Miriam . . . her brother, Bob . . .

COL. LANDA

—How old is Bob?

PERRIER:

Thirty—thirty-one?

COL. LANDA

Continue.

PERRIER:

And the children . . . Amos . . . and Shosanna.

COL. LANDA

Ages of the children?

PERRIER:

Amos—six—I believe. And Shosanna

was fifteen or sixteen, I’m not really sure.

CUT TO:

EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY

The mother and her three daughters finish taking the laundry off the clothesline.

They can’t hear anything going on inside.

The three Nazi soldiers watch the three daughters.

BACK TO LANDA AND PERRIER

COL. LANDA

Well, I guess that should do it.

He begins gathering up his papers and putting them back into his attaché case.

The farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe.

COL. LANDA

However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?

PERRIER:

But of course.

The farmer stands up, goes over to the icebox, and takes out the carafe of milk. As he walks over and fills the Nazi colonel’s glass, the German officer talks.

COL. LANDA

Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?

PERRIER:

I have no interest in such things.

COL. LANDA

But you are aware of what they call me?

PERRIER:

I’m aware.

COL. LANDA

What are you aware of?

PERRIER:

That they call you “the Jew Hunter.”

COL. LANDA

Precisely! Now I understand your trepidation in repeating it.

Before he was assassinated, Heydrich

apparently hated the moniker the good people of Prague bestowed on him. Actually, why he would hate the name “the Hangman” is baffling to me. It would appear he did everything in

his power to earn it. But I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title, precisely because I’ve earned it.

As “the Jew Hunter” enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize with the French farmer.

COL. LANDA

The feature that makes me such an

effective

hunter

of the Jews is, as opposed

to most German

soldiers, I can

think like a Jew,

where they can

only think like

a German or, more

precisely, a

German

soldier.

Now if

one were

to determine what

attribute the

German

people share with a beast,

it would be the

cunning and predatory instinct of

a hawk.

COL. LANDA

(CON’T)

Negroes—gorillas—brain—lips—smell—physical strength—penis size.

But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would

be that of the rat.

Now the Führer and Goebbels’s propaganda have said pretty much the same thing. Where our conclusions differ is I don’t consider the comparison an insult. Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in. It’s a hostile world indeed. If a rat were to scamper through your front door right now, would you greet it with hostility?

PERRIER:

I suppose I would.

COL. LANDA

Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?

PERRIER:

Rats spread disease, they bite people—

COL. LANDA

Unless some fool is stupid enough to

try and handle a live one, rats don’t make it a practice of biting human beings. Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that was some time ago. In all your born days, has a rat ever caused you to be sick a day in your life? I propose to you, any disease a rat could spread a squirrel would equally carry.

Yet I assume you don’t share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?

PERRIER:

No.

COL. LANDA

Yet they are both rodents, are they

not? And except for the fact that one has a big bushy tail, while the other has a long repugnant tail of rodent skin, they even rather look alike, don’t they?

PERRIER:

It is an interesting thought,

Herr Colonel.

COL. LANDA

However, interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel. If a rat were to scamper through your door this very minute, would you offer it a saucer of your delicious milk?

PERRIER:

Probably not.

COL. LANDA

I didn’t think so. You don’t like them. You don’t really know why you don’t like them. All you know is, you find them repulsive.

(lets the

metaphor sink in)

What a tremendously hostile world a rat must endure. Yet not only does he survive, he thrives. And the reason for this is because our little foe has an instinct for survival and preservation second to none. And that, Monsieur, is what a Jew shares with a rat.

Consequently, a German soldier conducts

a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews. Where does the hawk look? He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic,

he looks in the cellar—he looks everywhere he would hide. But there are many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide. However, the reason the Führer brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.

Because I’m aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.

(changing tone)

May I smoke my pipe as well?

The farmer’s cool facade is little by little eroding.

PERRIER:

Please, colonel, make yourself at home.

The Jew Hunter removes both a pipe and a bag of tobacco fixings. The pipe, strangely enough, is a calabash, made from an S-shaped gourd with a yellow skin and made famous by Sherlock Holmes.

As the Nazi colonel busies himself with his smoking, he continues to hold court at the Frenchman’s table.

COL. LANDA

The other mistake the German soldiers make is their severe handling of the citizens who give shelter and aid to the Jews. These citizens are not enemies of the state. They are simply confused people, trying to make some sense out of the madness war creates.

These citizens do not need punishing. They simply need to be reminded of their duty in wartime.

Let’s use you as a example, Monsieur LaPadite. In this war, you have found yourself in the middle of a conflict that has nothing to do with yourself, your lovely ladies, or your cows—yet here you are.

So, Monsieur LaPadite, let me propose

a question. In this time of war, what is your number-one duty? Is it to fight

the Germans in the name of France to your last breath? Or is it to harass the occupying army to the best of your

ability? Or is it to protect the poor, unfortunate victims of warfare who can

not protect themselves?

Or is your number-one duty in this time of bloodshed to protect those very beautiful women who constitute your family?

The Colonel lets the last statement stand.

COL. LANDA

That was a question, Monsieur LaPadite. In this time of war, what do you consider your number- one duty?

PERRIER:

To protect my family.

COL. LANDA

Now, my job dictates that I must have

my men enter your home and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family’s name off my list.

COL. LANDA

(CON’T)

And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured, they will be.

That is, unless you have something to tell me that will make the conducting of a search unnecessary.

(pause)

I might add also that any information that makes the performing of my duty easier will not be met with punishment. Actually quite the contrary, it will be met with reward.

And that reward will be your family will cease to be harassed in any way

by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.

The farmer, pipe in mouth, stares across the table at his German opponent.

COL. LANDA

You are sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?

PERRIER:

Yes.

COL. LANDA

You’re sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren’t you?

PERRIER:

Yes.

COL. LANDA

Point out to me the areas where they’re hiding.

The farmer points out the areas on the floor where the Dreyfuses are underneath.

COL. LANDA

Since I haven’t heard any disturbance,

I assume that while they’re listening, they don’t speak English?

PERRIER:

Yes.

COL. LANDA

I’m going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade—is that clear?

PERRIER:

Yes.

Col. Landa stands up from the table and, switching to FRENCH, says,

SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA

Monsieur LaPadite, I thank you for your milk and your hospitality. I do believe our business here is done.

The Nazi officer opens the front door and silently motions for his men to approach the house.

COL. LANDA

Madame LaPadite, I thank you for your time. We shan’t be bothering your family any longer.

The soldiers enter the doorway. Col. Landa silently points out the area of the floor the Jews are hiding under.

COL. LANDA

So, Monsieur and Madame LaPadite,

I bid you adieu.

He motions to the soldiers with his index finger.

They TEAR UP the wooden floor with MACHINE-GUN FIRE.

The little farmhouse is filled with SMOKE, DUST, SPLINTERS, SCREAMS, BULLET CASINGS, and even a little BLOOD.

With a hand motion from the colonel, the soldiers cut off their gunfire. The colonel keeps his finger in the air to indicate silence.

UNDERNEATH THE FLOORBOARDS

The entire Dreyfus family lies dead. Except for sixteen-year-old SHOSANNA, who miraculously escaped being struck by the Nazis’ bullets. With her dead family surrounding her, the young girl goes for freedom (represented by a wire-mesh vent).

COL. LANDA

hears a movement underneath the floor, looks down, and sees a SHAPE moving forward between the planks in the floor.

COL. LANDA

It’s the girl. Nobody move!

VENT:

is KICKED open, the girl SPRINGS out.

COL. LANDA

as he crosses the floor, sees the young girl RUNNING toward the cover of the woods. He unlatches the window and opens it. Shosanna is perfectly FRAMED in the windowsill.

SHOSANNA:

COL. LANDA

Au revoir, Shosanna!

SHOSANNA:

makes it to the woods and is gone.

The S.S. colonel closes the window.

EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY

The Nazi town car DRIVES away.

EXT—NAZI TOWN CAR (MOVING)—DAY

Col. Hans Landa sits in the backseat of the convertible that’s speeding away from the French farmhouse.

Landa speaks to his driver in GERMAN, SUBTITLE IN ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA

Herrman, I sense a question on your lips?

Out with it?

DRIVER:

Why did you allow an enemy of the state to escape?

COL. LANDA

Oh, I don’t think the state is in too much danger, do you?

DRIVER:

I suppose not.

COL. LANDA

I’m glad you see it my way. Besides,

not putting a bullet in the back of a fifteen- year-old girl and allowing

her to escape are not necessarily

the same thing. She’s a young girl, no food, no shelter, no shoes, who’s just witnessed the massacre of her entire family.

She may not survive the night. And after word spreads about what happened today, it’s highly unlikely she will find any willing farmers to extend her aid.

If I had to guess her fate, I’d say she’ll probably be turned in by some neighbor.

Or she’ll be spotted by some German soldier. Or we’ll find her body in the woods, dead from starvation or exposure. Or, perhaps . . . she’ll survive. She will elude capture. She will escape to America. She will move to New York City, where she will be elected President of

the United States.

The S.S. colonel chuckles at his little funny.

CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:

CHAPTER TWO:

“INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS”

FADE UP:

EXT—SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND—DAY

A bunch of SOLDIERS are lined up at attention.

LIEUTENANT ALDO RAINE, a hillbilly from the mountains of Tennessee, walks down the line. He recruits the men the

Germans will later call “The Basterds.” Lt. Aldo has one defining physical characteristic, a ROPE BURN around his neck—as if, once upon a time, he survived a LYNCHING.

The scar will never once be mentioned.

LT. ALDO

My name is Lt. Aldo Raine, and I’m puttin’ together a special team.

And I need me eight soldiers. Eight—Jewish—American—soldiers. Now y’all might of heard rumors about the armada happening soon. Well, we’ll be leavin’ a little earlier. We’re gonna be dropped into France, dressed as civilians. And once we’re in enemy territory, as

a bushwackin’, guerrilla army, we’re gonna be doin’ one thing, and one thing only—Killin’ Nazis.

The members of the National Socialist Party have conquered Europe through murder, torture, intimidation, and terror. And that’s exactly what we’re gonna do to them. Now I don’t know ’bout y’all? But I sure as hell didn’t come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross five thousand miles

of water, fight my way through half Sicily, and then jump out of a fuckin’ air-o-plane to teach the Nazis

lessons in humanity. Nazi ain’t got

no humanity. They’re the foot soldiers of a Jew-hatin’, mass-murderin’ maniac, and they need to be destroyed.

That’s why any and every son-of-a-bitch we find wearin’ a Nazi uniform, they’re gonna die.

LT. ALDO

(CON’T)

We will be cruel to the Germans, and through our cruelty, they will

know who we are. They will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered, and

disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us. And the Germans will not be able to help themselves from imagining the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and

our bootheels, and the edge of our knives.

And the Germans will be sickened by us. And the Germans will talk about us.

And the Germans will fear us.

And when the Germans close their eyes at night and their subconscious

tortures them for the evil they’ve done, it will be thoughts of us

that it tortures them with.

He stops pacing and looks at everybody.

LT. ALDO

Sound good?

They all say:

ALL:

Yes, sir!

LT. ALDO

That’s what I like to hear. But I

got a word of warning to all would-be warriors. When you join my command,

you take on debit. A debit you owe

me, personally. Every man under my command owes me one hundred Nazi scalps. And I want my scalps.

And all y’all will git me one hundred Nazi scalps, taken from the heads of one hundred dead Nazis . . .

or you will die trying.

“BAVARIA

BERCHTESGADEN:

(HITLER’S PRIVATE LAIR)”

INT—BERCHTESGADEN—DAY

In a huge room, ADOLF HITLER pounds on a big table with his fist as he rants at TWO GERMAN GENERALS.

They speak GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

HITLER:

How much more of these Jew swine must I endure? They butcher my men like they were fish bait! This pack of filthy degenerates are doing what

the Russian army didn’t and Patton’s army couldn’t—turning soldiers of

the Third Reich into superstitious old women!

GERMAN GENERAL:

Just the cowards among them, mein Führer.

Hitler pounds furiously on the desk with his fist.

HITLER:

No, no, no, no, no, no! I have heard

the rumors myself! Soldiers of the Third Reich, who have brought the world to their knees, now pecking and clucking like chickens. Do you know the latest rumor they’ve conjured up, in their fear-induced delirium? The one that beats

my boys with a bat. The one they call “the Bear Jew” . . . is a golem.

An avenging Jew angel, conjured up by a vengeful rabbi, to smite the Aryans!

GENERAL:

Mein Führer, this is just soldiers’ gossip. No one really believes the

Bear Jew is a golem.

HITLER:

Why not? They seem to be able to elude capture like an apparition.

They seem to be able to appear and disappear at will.

HITLER:

(CON’T)

You want to prove they’re flesh and blood? Then

BRING THEM TO ME!

I will hang them naked, by their heels, from the Eiffel Tower! And then throw their bodies in the sewers, for the rats of Paris to feast!

The Führer sits down at the table to compose himself and wipe his greasy black hair out of his face.

HITLER:

(disgusted)

The Bear Jew.

He hits the button on the intercom on his desk.

HITLER:

Kliest!

KLIEST’S VOICE comes out of the intercom:

KLIEST’S VOICE (OS)

Yes, mein Führer.

HITLER:

I have an order I want relayed to all German soldiers stationed in France.

The Jew degenerate known as the Bear Jew henceforth is never to be referred to as the Bear Jew again. We will cease to aid the Americans any longer in their attempt to

undermine the German soldier’s psyche. Did you get that, Kliest?

KLIEST’S VOICE (OS)

Yes, mein Führer. Do you still wish to see Private Butz?

HITLER:

Who and what is a private Butz?

KLEIST’S VOICE (OS)

He’s the soldier you wanted to see personally. His squad was ambushed

by Lt. Raine’s Jews. He was its only survivor.

HITLER:

Indeed I do want to see him. Thank you for reminding me. Send him in.

EXT—FRENCH WOODS—DAY

CU FACE OF DEAD GERMAN SOLDIER

His head lies on the ground, horizontal. A HAND reaches into

the FRAME, KNOCKS aside the dead German patriot’s helmet, and grabs a handful of the cadaver’s blond hair. A LARGE KNIFE

ENTERS THE FRAME and begins SLICING ALONG THE HAIRLINE.

This process is called SCALPING.

After SLICING is complete, the SCALP easily peels off, like a banana skin.

GERMAN PRISONERS PVT. BUTZ AND SGT. RACHTMAN on their knees, hand behind their heads.

Pvt. Butz NARRATES the scene in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

PVT. BUTZ (VO)

Werner and I were the only ones left alive after the ambush. While one man guarded us, the rest removed the hair. All the Basterds wore German scalps

tied to their belts.

CU SCALPS:

hanging from belts.

PVT. BUTZ (VO)

They not only took valuables . . .

PVT. BUTZ (VO)

The Basterds took their lives, their hair, their valuables, their identity, and finally their dignity in death.

True that. The sight of the dead soldiers with bare feet does rob the tableau of a certain dignity that is normally felt in battlefield shots.

BACK TO THE BASTERDS

Aldo screams to the Basterd who’s guarding the two German prisoners.

LT. ALDO

Hey, Hirschberg, send that kraut sarge over.

BASTERD PFC. HIRSCHBERG

KICKS Sgt. Rachtman in the back.

PFC. HIRSCHBERG

You! Go!

Sgt. Rachtman is a little slow to respond. So Hirschberg grabs him by the hair, YANKS him to his feet, and KICKS him in the ass, sending him on his way.

Most of the Basterds sit in a circle, Indian style, with Aldo in the middle.

As Sgt. Rachtman walks toward this circle of Basterds,

An OFFSCREEN LITERARY NARRATOR (not Pvt. Butz) speaks over the SOUNDTRACK in ENGLISH:

NARRATOR (VO)

Sergeant Werner Rachtman has seen many interrogations since Germany decided it should rule Europe. But this is the first time he’s ever been on the wrong end of the exchange.

It’s always been his belief that

only a weakling in mind, body, and spirit

complies with the enemy under threat of consequence. As Werner watched men cry like women,

pleadingly offer their knowledge, in exchange for their worthless lives, he made a vow to himself.

If his role is to die in this conflict, when they put him under the earth,

his dignity would be buried with him. For in the other world, the gods only respect the ones they test first.

Well, Sergeant, this is your test. And the gods are watching.

The captured German sergeant enters the circle of Basterds, stands straight before the sitting southern lieutenant, and salutes his captor.

SGT. RACHTMAN

(ENGLISH)

Sgt. Werner Rachtman.

Aldo returns the salute, looking at up him.

LT. ALDO

Lt. Aldo Raine. Pleased to meet cha.

You know what sit down means, Werner?

SGT. RACHTMAN

Yes.

LT. ALDO

Then sit down.

The German sergeant does.

LT. ALDO

How’s your English, Werner? Cause if need be, we gotta couple fellas

can translate.

Aldo points at one of the Basterds in the circle,

CPL. WILHELM WICKI.

LT. ALDO

Wicki there, an Austrian Jew, got the fuck outta Salzberg while the

gettin’ was good. Became American, got drafted, and came back to give y’all what for.

Then Aldo points to another Basterd. A big, scary-looking Basterd, in a German sergeant’s uniform, named SGT. HUGO STIGLITZ.

LT. ALDO

And another one over there you

might be familiar with, Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz. Heard of ’em?

The two German sergeants look at each other.

SGT. RACHTMAN

Everybody in the German army’s heard of Hugo Stiglitz.

The Basterds laugh, and a couple pat Hugo on the back.

The NARRATOR comes back on the SOUNDTRACK.

NARRATOR (VO) The reason for Hugo Stiglitz’s celebrity among German soldiers is simple.

WE SEE A PHOTO OF HUGO on the front page of the Nazi version of Stars and Stripes (the military newspaper).

NARRATOR (VO)

As a German enlisted man, he killed thirteen Gestapo officers, mostly

majors.

WE SEE THE MILITARY PHOTOS OF ALL THIRTEEN GESTAPO OFFICERS.

NARRATOR (VO)

Instead of putting him up against

a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin, to be made an example of.

Hugo in chains, being put in a lone troop truck, part of a prison convoy, en route to Berlin.

NARRATOR (VO)

Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.

EXT—FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE—DAY

The Basterds AMBUSH the prison convoy, killing everybody.

They walk to the back of the troop truck. Inside, Hugo, in chains, stares back at them.

LT. ALDO

Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz?

Hugo nods.

LT. ALDO

I’m Lt. Aldo Raine, and these are the Basterds. Ever heard of us?

Hugo nods his head, yes.

LT. ALDO

We just wanna say, we’re a big fan of your work. When it comes to killin’ Nazis, I think you show great talent, and I pride myself on havin’ an eye for that kind of talent. But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur. We all came here to see if you wanna go pro?

BACK TO THE BASTERD CIRCLE.

LT. ALDO

Now Werner, I’m gonna assume you know who we are?

SGT. RACHTMAN

Aldo the Apache.

The circle of Basterds giggle.

LT. ADLO

Well, Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain’t in the

prisoner-takin’ business. We in the killin’ Nazi business. And cousin, business is boomin’.

The Basterds laugh.

LT. ALDO

Now that leaves two ways we can play this out. Either kill ya or let ya

go. Now whether or not you gonna leave this circle alive depends entirely on you.

Aldo takes out a map of the area and lays it out in front of his prisoner.

LT. ALDO

Up the road a piece, there’s a

orchard. ’Sides you, we know there’s another kraut patrol fuckin’ around

here somewhere. Now if that patrol

were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper’s delight. Now if you ever wanna eat

a sauerkraut sandwich again, you gotta show me on this map where

they are, you gotta tell me how many they are, and you gotta tell me

what kinda artillery they carrying with ’em.

SGT. RACHTMAN

You can’t expect me to divulge information that would put German

lives in danger.

LT. ALDO

Well, Werner, that’s where you’re wrong. Because that’s exactly what I expect.

I need to know about Germans hidin’ in trees. And you need to tell me. And you need to tell me, right now. Now take your finger and point out

on this map where this party’s bein’ held, how many’s comin’, and what they brought to play with.

Werner sits, head held high, back straight, chin up, every inch the German hero facing death.

SGT. WERNER

I respectfully refuse, sir.

Aldo jerks his thumb behind him.

LT. ALDO

You see that ole boy battin’ rocks?

WE RACK-FOCUS to one of the Basterds not in the circle. He’s wearing a wife beater and power-hitting stones with a baseball bat.

Werner’s eyes go to the ballplayer.

LT. ALDO

That’s Sgt. Donny Donowitz. But you might know him better by his nickname, the Bear Jew. Now if you heard of

Aldo the Apache, you gotta heard about the Bear Jew?

SGT. RACHTMAN

I heard.

LT. ALDO

What did you hear?

SGT. RACHTMAN

He beats German soldiers with a club.

LT. ALDO

He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.

SGT. DONOWITZ

back to us, still haven’t seen his face. He Babe Ruths a rock soaring into the atmosphere.

LT. ALDO

Now, Werner, I’m gonna ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still “respectfully refuse,” I’m calling the Bear Jew over here, and he’s gonna take that big bat of his, and he’s gonna beat your ass to death with it.

Now take your Wiener-schnitzel-lickin’ finger and point out on this map

what I want to know.

SGT. RACHTMAN

Fuck you and your Jew dogs.

Instead of getting mad, the Basterds burst out LAUGHING.

Also says to Werner, with a giggle in his voice:

LT. ALDO

Actually, Werner, we’re all tickled

ya said that. Frankly, watchin’ Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest

we ever get to goin’ to the movies. (YELLING)

He turns to the CAMERA and yells:

That the idea, Mr. Goorowitz.

MR. GOOROWITZ

What can I do you for, Donny?

DONNY:

I need a baseball bat.

The store owner leads him to a basket with eight bats in it. Donny starts going through them without saying anything.

Mr. Goorowitz watches.

MR. GOOROWITZ

You gettin’ your little brother a present before you ship out?

Donny, concentrating on the bats, not looking up:

DONNY:

No.

Donny’s “no” silences the gabby Goorowitz. He seems to settle on one, feeling its weight in his hands.

DONNY:

Can I try this one on for size, outside?

Extending his arm:

MR. GOOROWITZ

Be my guest.

The phone rings.

MR. GOOROWITZ

I’ll get that. You go right ahead.

The proprietor answers the phone and gets into a conversation with his OFFSCREEN mother.

Donny walks outside. WE STAY IN STORE but can see him clearly through the store’s big picture window.

However, Mr. Goorowitz instinctively turns his back to Donny to speak with his mother.

Donny starts swinging the bat. It’s pretty obvious he’s pantomiming beating somebody to death with it. Then

he starts yelling:

DONNY:

Take that, ya Nazi basterd! You like

fuckin’ with the Jews? Wanna fuck with the Jews? The American Jews are gonna FUCK with you . . . !

Mr. Goorowitz sees none of this as he speaks to his

mother. He hangs up the phone just as Donny walks back into the store. The store owner turns to the store customer.

DONNY:

Is this the heaviest ya got?

CUT TO:

INT—HALLWAY APARTMENT BUILDING—DAY

Donny, dressed nice, in an apartment building in his Jewish Boston neighbourhood. He knocks on a door.

A VERY OLD JEWISH WOMAN opens the door, only a little, peering out at the young man.

OLD WOMAN:

How can I help you?

DONNY:

Mrs. Himmelstein?

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

State your business, young man.

DONNY:

Mrs. Himmelstein, I’m Donny Donowitz.

My father, Sy Donowitz, owns the barber shop on

Greeny Ave. Sy’s Barber Shop.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

I’ve seen it. Do you live in the neighborhood?

DONNY:

All my life.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

Again, state your business?

DONNY:

May I have a word with you?

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

What about?

DONNY:

Our people in Europe.

She thinks for a beat, then holds the door open for the young man.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

Come in. Would you like some tea?

INT—MRS. HIMMELSTEIN’S APARTMENT—DAY

Donny sits on an overstuffed sofa, holding a tea cup and

saucer in his hand. Mrs. Himmelstein sits on an overstuffed chair, holding her tea, looking across at her visitor.

DONNY:

(sipping tea)

Very good.

MRS. HIMMSELSTEIN

If you like tea.

Donny chuckles at her little joke. The old woman remains

stone. She wasn’t joking. He places his saucer on the coffee table and begins:

DONNY:

Mrs. Himmelstein, do you have any loved ones over in Europe who you’re concerned for?

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

What compels you, young man, to ask a stranger such a personal question?

DONNY:

Because I’m going to Europe. And I’m gonna make it right.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

And just how do intend to do that, Joshua?

He holds up his bat.

DONNY:

With this.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

And what exactly do you intend to do with that toy?

DONNY:

I’m gonna beat every Nazi I find to death with it.

She takes another sip of tea.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

I thought we were having tea together.

Donny picks up his cup and takes a sip.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

And in this pursuit, how is it that I can be of service?

DONNY:

I’m going through the neighborhood.

If you have any loved ones in Europe whose safety you fear for, I’d like

you to write their name on my bat.

BACK TO BASTERDS

Donna takes a long walk to Werner . . .

PVT. BUTZ

watches all this . . .

As WE CUT BACK and FORTH BETWEEN DONNY WALKING and WERNER WAITING, WE ALSO CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN DONNY and

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN . . .

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

You must be a real basterd, Donny.

DONNY:

You bet your sweet ass I am.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

Hand me your sword, Gideon. I do believe I will join you on this journey.

She signs the BAT: “MADELEINE.”

Donny steps up to the plate, looking down at the Nazi:

He sees the Iron Cross hanging from the German Sgt’s right pocket. The Jew taps the German’s medal with the end of his bat.

DONNY:

You get that for killing jews?

SGT RACHTMAN:

Bravery.

Donny gives him a “oh yeah, we’ll see about that,” look.

The Bear Jew raises the bat up high over his shoulder and brings it down hard against the side of Rachtman’s head.

Donny BEATS Werner TO DEATH WITH THE BAT, to the cheers of the Basterds.

PVT. BUTZ

watches. Hirschberg says to him:

PFC. HIRSCHBERG

About now, I’d be shittin’ my pants, if I was you.

Aldo points a finger at Butzs and crooks it toward him.

A crying, visibly shaken Butz sits down in front of Aldo.

LT. ALDO

You wanna live?

PVT. BUTZ

Yes, sir.

LT. ALDO

Point out on this map the German position.

His arm shoots out like a rocket and points out the positions.

PVT. BUTZ

This area here.

LT. ALDO

How many?

PVT. BUTZ

Maybe twelve.

LT. ALDO

What kind of artillery?

PVT BUTZ:

They have a machine gun dug in here pointing north.

BACK TO HITLER:

HITLER:

How did you survive this ordeal?

WE SEE Pvt. Butz in the Führer’s room for the first time.

He wears a Nazi cap, which is unusual in the presence of the Führer, but he seems okay with it.

PVT. BUTZ

They let me go.

FROM HERE ON WE GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ALDO AND HITLER.

LT. ALDO

Now, when you report what happened here, you can’t tell ’em you told us what you told us. They’ll shoot ya. But they’re gonna wanna know, why you so special, we let you live? So tell ’em we let ya live so you could spread the word through the ranks what’s gonna happen to every Nazi we find.

HITLER:

You are not to tell anybody anything! Not one word of detail! Your outfit

was ambushed, and you got away. Not one more word.

PVT. BUTZ

Yes, mein Führer.

Pause.

HITLER:

Did they mark you like they did the other survivors?

PVT. BUTZ

Yes, mein Führer.

HITLER:

Remove your hat and show me.

LT. ALDO

Now say we let ya go, and say you survive the war? When you get back

home, what ’cha gonna do?

PVT. BUTZ

I will hug my mother like I’ve never hugged her before.

LT. ALDO

Well, ain’t that a real nice boy. Are you going to take off your uniform?

PVT. BUTZ

Not only shall I remove it, but I intend to burn it!

The young German is telling Aldo what he thinks Aldo wants to hear. But the last answer didn’t go down as well as he thought it would, as is evident by the frown on Aldo’s face.

LT. ALDO

Yeah, that’s what we thought. We don’t like that. You see, we like our Nazis

in uniforms. That way, you can spot ’em just like that.

(snaps his fingers)

But you take off that uniform, ain’t nobody gonna know you was a Nazi.

And that don’t sit well with us.

Aldo removes a LARGE KNIFE from a sheath on his belt.

LT. ALDO

So I’m gonna give ya a little somethin’ you can’t take off.

BACK TO HITLER:

Pvt. Butz removes his combat helmet. Hair hangs in his face. He moves it aside, and WE SEE a SWASTIKA has been HAND-

CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD.

BACK TO BASTERDS BUTZ’S POV

on ground, looking up at them. Aldo has just carved the swastika, and he’s holding the bloody knife. All the Basterds crowd around to admire his handiwork.

SGT. DONOWITZ

You know, Lieutenant, you’re getting pretty good at that.

LT. ALDO

You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don’t cha? Practice.

FADE TO BLACK:

OVER BLACK:

CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:

CHAPTER THREE:

“GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS”

INT—CINEMA AUDITORIUM—NIGHT

We’re in the auditorium of a cinema in Paris. However, the

CAMERA is pointed in the direction of the audience, not the screen. We start CLOSE on the projector beam emanating from

the little glass window in the back of the theater.

The CAMERA continues to DOLLY back, making the shot wider and wider, bringing in more and more the German-occupied citizens of Paris, who stare at the OFFSCREEN silver screen in the dark.

We can hear the OFFSCREEN SOUNDTRACK of a Goebbels-produced German omm-pa-pa musical movie being projected.

The shot continues to pull farther and farther back, and the German dialogue continues to fill the auditorium . . .

UNTIL . . .

The DOLY SHOT LANDS on a CLOSEUP of Shosanna, watching the movie.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS:

“SHOSANNA DREYFUS

TWO WEEKS AFTER THE MASSACRE

OF SHOSANNA’S FAMILY”

We hear the sound of the German musical’s climax.

The lights go up in the auditorium.

Shosanna, dressed in a NURSE’S UNIFORM she swiped from

somewhere, remains seated, as the rest of the PATRONS gather their coats and file out.

EXT—LITTLE CINEMA (PARIS)—NIGHT

Patrons exit under the cinema marquee, as someone from inside SHUTS OFF the marquee’s lights.

The MARQUEE READS in French:

“GERMAN NIGHT BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK in MADCAP IN MEXICO.”

EXT—PROJECTION BOOTH (LITTLE CINEMA)

A French black man, who we will learn later is named MARCEL,

is the cinema’s projectionist. We see him for a moment, taking the film reels off the projector and placing them on rewinds.

INT—AUDITORIUM

CU SHOSANNA:

Still sitting in her seat. Except for her, the auditorium is empty.

The owner of the cinema, an attractive-looking French woman, who we will later know as MADAME MIMIEUX, appears in

one of the cinema’s opera-box balconies.

Looking down from her porch at the young girl, sitting in the empty cinema.

The DIALOGUE will be spoken in FRENCH and SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

So, young woman, since it’s beyond obvious we’re closed for the evening, I must assume you want something. What can I do for you?

SHOSANNA:

May I sleep here tonight?

MADAME MIMIEUX:

So I gather you’re not a nurse?

SHOSANNA:

No.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

But you’re a bright little thing. That’s a clever disguise. Where is your family?

SHOSANNA:

Murdered.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

So you’re a war orphan?

SHOSANNA:

We were from Nancy. The Boches found us—

MADAME MIMIEUX:

—Is this a sad story?

SHOSANNA.

Oui.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

Sad stories bore me. These days everyone in Paris has one. I haven’t bored you with mine. Don’t bore me with yours.

SHOSANNA:

You can run the machines?

MADAME MIMIEUX:

What machines?

Using her hands to pantomime the rotating film reels on a projector, she says:

SHOSANNA:

The machines that show the film.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

The projectors? Yes, I own a cinema.

Of course I can operate them.

SHOSANNA:

I know, I saw you.

FLASH ON:

CU SHOSANNA:

eyes creeping up the stairway in the projection booth, watching . . .

MADAME MIMIEUX:

expertly working the projectors . . .

BACK TO SHOSANNA

SHOSANNA:

Teach me. Teach me to run the machines that show the film. It’s only you and

the negro. I know you could use some help.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

I know at least six people who’ve been put up against a wall and machine-

gunned for sheltering enemies of the state. I have no intention of being unlucky number seven. How long have

you been in Paris?

SHOSANNA:

A week and a few days.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

How have you survived the curfew without capture?

SHOSANNA:

I sleep on rooftops.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

Again, I’m forced to admit, clever girl. How is it?

SHOSANNA:

Cold.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

(laughs)

I can imagine.

SHOSANNA:

Respectfully, no you can’t.

Pause.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

Fair enough.

Thinks . . .

MADAME MIMIEUX:

So you can’t operate a 35mm film projector. You want me to teach you, in order to work here, in order to use my cinema as a hole to hide in. Is that correct?

SHOSANNA:

Oui.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

What’s your name?

SHOSANNA:

Shosanna.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

I’m Madame Mimieux. You may call me Madame. This is a cinema. Not a home for wayward war orphans.

Having said that, what you say is true. If you were truly exceptional, I could find use for you. So, Shosanna, are you truly exceptional?

SHOSANNA:

Oui, Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

I will be the judge of that.

DISSOLVE TO:

TITLE CARD:

Which shows a lovely PENCIL SKETCH of the CITY OF PARIS, complete with Eiffel Tower.

ABOVE IT READS:

“1944

PARIS”

THEN . . .

The CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we see we’re not looking at a TITLE CARD at all, but a CALENDER stuck on the wall of the little cinema’s projection booth. Before we leave it, WE SEE the

month is JUNE . . .

The CAMERA finds the THREE-YEARS-OLDER SHOSANNA working

as the PROJECTIONIST. It would appear that Shosanna passed Madame Mimieux’s exceptional test.

Alyrical, Morricone-like tune PLAYS on the SOUNDTRACK. This will be “Shosanna’s Theme.”

A little bell begins RINGING on one of the projectors, alerting Shosanna its time for a REEL CHANGE.

Shosanna stands at the projector, watching the old German film she’s projecting, waiting for the FIRST REEL CHANGE MARK . . .

SILVER:

SCREEN:

of the

little

cinema. Onscreen

LENI RIEFENSTAHL lies

horizontal as

an icicle drips on her head in the old

German

film “The White Hell of

Pitz Palu.”

The FIRST REEL

CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the upper-right-

hand corner of

the FRAME (that

tells the projectionist

to get

ready).

As the FILM REEL on the FIRST PROJECTOR rolls out, Shosanna stands ready, waiting by the SECOND PROJECTOR . . .

WHEN . . .

SILVER SCREEN:

the SECOND REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the same place (that’s the one).

SHOSANNA:

THROWS the lever on the SECOND PROJECTOR, switching the film from projector 1 to projector 2, executing a perfect REEL CHANGE.

As “Shosanna’s Theme” plays on the soundtrack, we watch, via MONTAGE, her go through her daily chores: carry heavy film cans up the stairs, empty the rat traps, etc, etc. . . .

EXT—CINEMA—NIGHT

The MARQUEE READS in French:

“GERMAN NIGHT LENI RIEFENSTAHL in PABST’S WHITE HELL OF PITZ PALU”

Shosanna emerges from the cinema carrying two buckets of LETTERS (for the marquee) and a tall ladder. Her chore here, obviously, is to change the show on the marquee.

The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack in ENGLISH:

NARRATOR (VO)

To operate a cinema in Paris during

the occupation, one had two choices. Either you could show new German propaganda films, produced under the watchful

eye of Joseph Goebbels. Or . . . you could have a German night in your weekly schedule and show allowed German classic films.

Their German night was Thursday.

Shosanna, by herself, perched up high on the ladder, changing the letters on the marquee.

A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER (about the same age as Shosanna) walks out of the cinema. He sees the ladder with the young French girl on top and walks over.

They speak FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

GERMAN SOLDIER:

What starts tomorrow?

Shosanna looks down, seeing the young German soldier smiling up at her from below.

SHOSANNA:

A Max Linder festival.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Ummm, I always preferred Linder to Chaplin. Except Linder never made a

film as good as “The Kid.” The chase climax of “The Kid,” superb.

Shosanna continues working, not adding to the conversation.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

I suppose now you could use an M, an A, and an X?

SHOSANNA:

No need, I can manage.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Don’t be ridiculous. It’s my pleasure.

He hands the French damsel the letters spelling MAX.

SHOSANNA:

Merci.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

I adore your cinema very much.

SHOSANNA:

Merci.

She busies herself with the marquee letters . . .

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Is it yours?

SHOSANNA:

Do I own it?

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Oui.

SHOSANNA:

Oui.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

How does a young girl such as yourself own a cinema?

Due to his uniform and Shosanna’s situation, his efforts at trying to make small talk strike the young Jewess in hiding as a Gestapo interrogation.

SHOSANNA:

My aunt left it to me.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Lucky girl.

Shosanna makes no reply back.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Merci for hosting a German night.

SHOSANNA:

I don’t have a choice, but you’re welcome.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Do you choose the German films yourself?

SHOSANNA:

Oui.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Then my merci stands. I love the Riefenstahl mountain films, especially “Pitz Palu.” It’s nice to see a French girl who’s an admirer of Riefenstahl.

SHOSANNA:

“Admire” would not be the adjective

I would use to describe my feelings toward Fräulein Riefenstahl.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

But you do admire the director Pabst, don’t you? That’s why you included

his name on the marquee.

She climbs down from the ladder and faces the German private.

SHOSANNA:

I’m French. We respect directors in our country.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Apparently even Germans.

SHOSANNA:

Even Germans. Merci for your assistance,

Private. Adieu.

She turns to go back inside.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

You’re not finished?

SHOSANNA:

I’ll finish in the morning.

She opens the door to go inside.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

May I ask your name?

SHOSANNA:

You wish to see my papers?

She hands him her excellently forged papers.

That’s obviously not what he meant, but he takes them anyway to read her name.

COL. LANDA

Emmanuelle Mimieux. That’s a very pretty name.

SHOSANNA:

Merci. Are you finished with my papers?

He hands them back.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Mademoiselle. My name is Frederick Zoller.

She gives no response.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

It’s been a pleasure chatting with a fellow cinema lover. Sweet dreams, Mademoiselle.

He gives her a little salute and walks into the black of a curfew- imposed night.

She looks after him. She didn’t show it, but he kind of got to her. After all, for any true cinema lover, it’s hard to hate anybody who, CINEMA MON AMOUR.

EXT—ROOFTOP CINEMA—NIGHT

Shosanna stands on the roof her her cinema, late at night, lighting up a cigarette. As she takes her first big drag,

she remembers a voice.

FLASH ON:

MADAME MIMIEUX, the younger Shosanna, and the black projectionist, Marcel, in the projection booth. Shosanna

lights up a cigarette, and Madame Mimieux SLAPS her face HARD, knocking the cigarette out of her mouth. Marcel quickly STAMPS it out on the floor.

MADAME:

MIMIEUX:

If I ever see

you light

up a cigarette in my

cinema again,

I’ll turn

you in to the Nazis, do

you understand?

Shosanna is shocked by this statement.

SHOSANNA:

Oui, Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

And for bringing an open flame into my cinema, you deserve far worse than a Nazi Jewish boxcar. With your thick head, what do you think the highest priority of a cinema manager is? Keeping this fucking place from burning down to the ground, that’s what!

In my collection, I have over three hundred and fifty 35mm, nitrate film prints, which are not only immensely flammable but highy unstable. And should they catch fire, they burn three times faster than paper. If that happens . . .

POOF . . . all gone, cinema no more, everybody burned alive. If I ever

see you with an open flame in my cinema again, I won’t turn you into the Nazis. I’ll kill you myself. And the fucking Germans will give me a curfew pass.

Do you understand me?

SHOSANNA:

Oui, Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

Do you believe me?

SHOSANNA:

Oui, Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

You damn well better.

BACK TO ROOF:

Shosanna exhales cigarette smoke.

Marcel comes onto the roof.

MARCEL:

Are you well?

SHOSANNA:

Even on the roof I can’t smoke a cigarette without hearing Madame’s

voice yelling at me. That’s why I

do it. To hear Madame’s voice again.

MARCEL:

We both miss her.

SHOSANNA:

I know. I’m fine, darling. I’ll be to bed soon.

Marcel goes back inside. Shosanna smokes.

INT—FRENCH BISTRO—AFTERNOON

Shosanna sits in the back of a French bistro, reading a book, “The Saint in New York,” by Leslie Charteris, drinking wine when the young German soldier from the other day,

FREDRICK ZOLLER, walks in. He gets a beer, then notices the French girl sitting in the back. He smiles and heads over

to her. “Oh no, not this guy again,” she thinks.

Again they speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

FREDRICK:

May I join you?

SHOSANNA:

Look, Fredrick—

FREDRICK:

(smiling)

—You remember my name?

SHOSANNA:

Yes . . . Look, you seem a pleasant enough fellow—

FREDRICK:

—Merci.

SHOSANNA:

You’re welcome. Regardless, I want you to stop pestering me.

FREDRICK:

I apologize, Mademoiselle. I wasn’t trying to be a pest. I was simply

trying to be friendly.

SHOSANNA:

I don’t wish to be your friend.

FREDRICK:

Why not?

SHOSANNA:

Don’t act like an infant. You know why.

FREDRICK:

I’m more than just a uniform.

SHOSANNA:

Not to me. If you are so desperate for

a French girlfriend, I suggest you try Vichy.

Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously very impressed with Fredrick. They make a fuss over him in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which neither Shosanna or the non-German- speaking members of the movie’s audience can understand.

He signs autographs for them and shakes their hands, and they go on their way.

Shosanna’s eyes narrow.

SHOSANNA:

Who are you?

FREDRICK:

I thought I was just a uniform.

SHOSANNA:

You’re not just a German soldier. Are you somebody’s son?

FREDRICK:

Most German soldiers are somebody’s son.

SHOSANNA:

Yeah, but you’re not just somebody. What are you, Hitler’s nephew?

He leans in across the table. She leans in too, and he says:

FREDRICK:

Yes.

SHOSANNA:

Really?

FREDRICK:

No, not really. I’m just teasing you.

She leans back, annoyed.

SHOSANNA:

Then what is it? What are you, a German movie star?

FREDRICK:

Not exactly.

SHOSANNA:

(Pfuit) What does that mean, “not exactly”? I asked if you were a movie star. The answer to that question is yes or no.

Fredrick laughs at that line.

FREDRICK:

When you said that just now, you reminded me of my sister.

This catches young Shosanna off guard.

FREDRICK:

I come from a home of six sisters.

We run a family-operated cinema in Munich. Seeing you run around your cinema reminds me of them. Especially my sister Helga. She raised me, when our father wasn’t up to the job. I admire her very much. You’d like her. She doesn’t wear a German uniform.

SHOSANNA:

You were raised by Helga?

FREDRICK:

All my sisters. I’m the baby, but Helga was the bossiest.

SHOSANNA:

And your mother and father?

FREDRICK:

My mother

died. And my father

was a

loser. My

father’s

motto:
“If

at first

you don’t

succeed,

quit.” The

day he

left,

good riddance.

My sisters

are

all I

need. It’s

why

I like your cinema.

It makes me feel

both

closer

to

them

and a

little homesick

at the

same time.

SHOSANNA:

Is your cinema still operating?

FREDRICK:

Oui.

SHOSANNA:

What’s it called?

FREDRICK:

The Kino Haus.

SHOSANNA:

How has it done during the war?

FREDRICK Actually, in Germany, cinema attendance is up.

SHOSANNA:

No doubt. You don’t have to operate under a curfew.

FREDRICK:

How often do you fill your house?

SHOSANNA:

(Pfuit) Not since before the war.

FREDRICK:

So if you had one big engagement, that would help you out?

SHOSANNA:

Of course, but that’s not likely to happen.

TWO MORE:

GERMAN:

SOLDIERS and their

TWO:

FRENCH:

DATES:

approach

the table. They

ask for

Fredrick’s

autograph,

and he signs it for

them. One of the French

girls

says, in

FRENCH, how exciting

it is to

meet a

real live

German war hero. Shosanna

hears

it. They

leave.

So that’s

it,

she thinks.

SHOSANNA:

So you’re a war hero? Why didn’t you tell me?

FREDRICK:

Everybody knows that. I liked that you didn’t.

SHOSANNA:

What did you do?

He takes a sip of beer.

FREDRICK:

I’ve shot the most enemy soldiers in World War Two . . . so far.

You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.

SHOSANNA:

Wow.

FREDRICK:

I was alone in a bell tower in a walled-off city in Russia. It was myself and a thousand rounds of ammo in a bird’s nest, against three hundred Soviet soldiers.

SHOSANNA:

What’s a bird’s nest?

FREDRICK:

A bird’s nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower. It’s a high structure, offering a three-hundred-and-sixty-degree view. Very advantageous for marksmen.

SHOSANNA:

How many Russians did you kill?

FREDRICK:

Sixty-eight.

(beat)

The first day. A hundred and fifty the second day. Thirty-two the third day.

On the fourth day, they exited the city. Naturally my war story received a lot of attention in Germany. That’s why they all recognize me. They call me the German Sergeant York.

SHOSANNA:

Maybe they’ll make a film about your exploits.

FREDRICK:

Well, that’s just what Joseph Goebbels thought. So he did. It’s called “Nation’s Pride,” and guess what, they wanted me to play myself, so I did. They have posters for it in kiosks all over Paris. That’s another reason for all the attention.

SHOSANNA:

“Nation’s Pride” is about you? “Nation’s Pride” is starring you?

FREDRICK:

I know, comical, huh?

SHOSANNA:

Not so comical. So what are you doing in Paris, enjoying a rest?

FREDRICK:

Hardly. I’ve been doing publicity, having my pictures taken with different German luminaries, visiting troops,

that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the film to premiere in Paris, so I’ve been helping them in the planning.

Joseph is very keen on this film.

He’s telling anybody who will listen that when “Nation’s Pride” is released

I’ll be the German Van Johnson.

Shosanna isn’t falling for the young German by any stretch. However, his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can’t help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as “Joseph,” like they’re friends, is all she needs to get on the right side of things. This young man is trouble with a capital T, and

she needs to stay far fucking away from him.

She abruptly rises and says:

SHOSANNA:

Well, good luck with your premiere, Private. I hope all goes well for

Joseph and yourself. Au revoir.

And with that, she disappears, leaving the perplexed private alone.

EXT—CINEMA MARQUEE—DAY

It’s the next day.

Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee.

Marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet.

Shosanna is alone outside the little cinema, perched up on her ladder.

WHEN . . .

. . . A BLACK NAZI SEDAN pulls up in front of the little cinema.

A GERMAN MAJOR in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of the back of the sedan.

The DRIVER, a German private, steps out as well.

Yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder:

Both GERMAN and FRENCH will be SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH.

GESTAPO MAJOR:

Mademoiselle Mimieux?

SHOSANNA:

Oui?

Telling his driver in German to ask her in French:

GESTAPO MAJOR:

Ask her if this is her cinema.

In French the driver asks Shosanna:

DRIVER:

Is this your cinema?

SHOSANNA:

Oui.

GESTAPO MAJOR:

Tell her to come down.

DRIVER:

Come down, please.

She climbs down the ladder.

The driver opens the back door of the sedan, indicating for her to get in.

SHOSANNA:

I don’t understand. What have I done?

DRIVER:

(to major)

She wants to know what she’s done?

GESTAPO MAJOR:

Who says she’s done anything?

DRIVER:

Who says you’ve done anything?

Then in her best imitation of Mademoiselle Mimeux’s arrogant manner.

SHOSANNA:

Then I demand to know what this is about, and where do you propose to take me?

The driver begins to translate when the Gestapo major holds up his hand, telling him not to bother. The major looks at the young French girl and tells her in German:

GESTAPO MAJOR:

Get your ass in that car.

No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car, followed by the Germans. The sedan takes off.

INT—SEDAN (MOVING)—DAY

The Nazi sedan drives through the early-afternoon Paris streets.

WE HOLD SHOSANNA IN TIGHT CU

the whole ride, never showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside her. We just hold on her face trying not to reveal anything.

The sedan stops.

The car door opens, and the driver offers Shosanna his hand.

EXT/INT—MAXIM’S (FAMOUS PARIS CAFÉ)—DAY

She steps out of the car and is led into a Paris café by the Gestapo officer. It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before she realizes she’s not being led to a Gestapo interrogation room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but to lunch.

The best table at Maxim’s. Three people, and two dogs, sit at it: Germany’s minister of propaganda and the number-two man in Hitler’s Third Reich, JOSEPH GOEBBELS; his female French translator (and mistress), FRANCESCA MONDINO; and young Private Zoller.

TWO BLACK FRENCH POODLES belonging to Mademoiselle Mondino sit together in another chair at the table.

We join the in mid-conversation:

They all speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

GOEBBELS:

—it’s only the offspring of slaves that

allows America to be competitive athletically. American Olympic gold can be measured

in Negro sweat.

Shosanna is led through the French eatery by the Gestapo major. Private Zoller sees her and stands up, excuses himself,

and greets her before she reaches the table.

Fredrick says in French, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

FREDRICK:

Good you came. I wasn’t sure whether or not you’d accept my invitation.

SHOSANNA:

Invitation?

THEN . . .

. . . Goebbels’s voice says OFFSCREEN:

GOEBBELS (OS)

Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?

Private Zoller turns in his direction, takes Shosanna by the arm, and leads her to him.

FREDRICK:

Yes, it is, Herr Goebbels. Emmanuelle, there is somebody I want you to meet.

Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons crème brûlée into his mouth.

The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda minister formally.

FREDRICK:

Emmanuelle Mimieux, I’d like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda, the leader of the entire German film industry, and now I’m an actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels.

Goebbels offers up his long, spiderlike fingers for Shosanna to shake. She does.

GOEBBELS:

Your reputation precedes you, Fräulein Mimieux.

He looks to Francesca to translate, but she’s just taken a big bite of tiramisu.

They all laugh.

Frederick jumps in . . .

FREDRICK:

And normally, this is Herr Goebbels’s French interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.

FRANCESCA:

looks up at Shosanna.

NARRATOR’S VOICE comes on soundtrack:

NARRATOR (VO)

Francesca Mondino is much more than Goebbels’s French interpreter.

She’s also Goebbels’s favorite French actress to appear in his films . . . . .

FLASH ON:

FRENCH CLIP:

from one of Francesca’s B/W Goebbels produced productions.

Francesca, dressed as a French peasant girl, with a YOUNG GERMAN (MOVIE) SOLDIER.

She speaks in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

FRANCESCA/PEASANT GIRL

I love you, I can’t help it. My country or my heart, which do I betray?

A SUBTITLE APPEARS below naming the film’s title:

“SENTIMENTAL COMBAT” (1943)

FLASH ON:

Francesca and Goebbels having sex in her boudoir, on her red velvet bed.

NARRATOR (VO)

And Goebbels’s favorite French mistress, to act in his bed.

WE SEE JUST A SUPER-QUICK SHOT OF Goebbels FUCKING Francesca DOGGY-

STYLE.

FRANCESCA:

(animal-like) Do it! Do it! Fuck me—fill me!

BACK TO FRANCESCA looking at Shosanna.

FRANCESCA:

Bonjour.

SHOSANNA:

Bonjour.

FREDRICK:

And you’ve met the major.

The Gestapo officer steps up and says to Fredrick in German:

GESTAPO MAJOR:

Actually, I didn’t introduce myself. (to Shosanna)

Major Dieter Hellstrom of the Gestapo, at your service, Mademoiselle.

(he clicks his heels)

Please allow me. Have a seat.

The Gestapo officer pulls out a chair for the young lady to sit down. Shosanna takes the hot seat. Seated to her right is Pvt. Zoller. To her left are the two curly, pampered poodles. Major Hellstrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine from a small carafe on the table.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Try the wine, Mademoiselle. It’s quite good.

Goebbels looks across the table at her.

GOEBBELS:

Well, I must say, you’ve made quite an impression on our boy.

Francesca interprets Goebbels’s German for Shosanna.

GOEBBELS:

I must say, Fräulein, I should be rather annoyed with you.

Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS:

I arrive in France, and I wish to have lunch with my star . . .

Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS Little do I know he’s become the toast of Paris, and now he must find time for me.

Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS:

People wait in line hours, days, to see me. For the Führer and Private Zoller, I wait.

Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS:

So finally, I’m granted an audience

with the young private, and he spends the entire lunch speaking of you

and your cinema.

Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS:

So Fräulein Mimieux, let’s get down to business.

Private Zoller interrupts—

FREDRICK:

Herr Goebbels, I haven’t informed her yet.

GOEBBELS:

Unless the girl’s a simpleton, I’m sure she’s figured it out by now. After all, she does operate a cinema. Francesca, tell her.

Francesca tells Shosanna in French:

FRANCESCA:

What they’re trying to tell you, Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has

spent the last hour at lunch,

trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels

to abandon previous plans for Private Zoller’s film premiere and change the venue to your cinema.

Zoller reacts.

FRANCESCA:

(FRENCH to Zoller)

What?

FREDRICK:

I wanted to inform her.

FRANCESCA:

Shit. I apologize, Private. Of course you did.

GOEBBELS:

(GERMAN to Francesca) What’s the issue?

FRANCESCA:

The young soldier wanted to inform the mademoiselle himself.

GOEBBELS:

Nonsense. Until I ask a few questions, he has nothing to inform. Let the record state, I have not agreed to a venue change.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Duly noted.

Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna:

GOEBBELS:

You have opera boxes?

SHOSANNA:

Oui.

GOEBBELS:

How many?

SHOSANNA:

Three.

GOEBBELS:

More would be better. How many seats in your auditorium?

SHOSANNA:

Three hundred and fifty.

GOEBBELS:

That’s almost four hundred less than The Ritz.

Fredrick jumps in . . .

FREDRICK:

But Herr Goebbels, that’s not such a terrible thing. You said yourself you didn’t want to indulge every two-faced French bourgeois taking up space currying favor. With less seats it makes the event more exclusive. You’re not trying to fill the house, they’re fighting for seats.

FREDRICK:

(CON’T)

Besides, to hell with the French. This is a German night, a German event, a German celebration. This

night is for you, me, the German military, the High Command, their

family and friends. The only people who should be allowed in the room are people who will be moved by the exploits onscreen.

Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit of a pause:

GOEBBELS:

I see your public speaking has improved. It appears I’ve created

a monster. A strangely persuasive monster. When the war’s over,

politics awaits.

Table chuckles.

GOEBBELS:

Well, Private, though it is true

I’m inclined to indulge you anything, I must watch a film in this young lady’s cinema before I can say

yes or no.

(to Shosanna)

So, young lady, you are to close your cinema tonight and have

a private screening for me.

Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS:

What German films do you have?

Francesca asks . . .

SHOSANNA:

My cinema, on German night, tends to show older German classics.

Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS:

Why not my films?

Francesca asks . . . ?

SHOSANNA:

I draw an older German audience in my cinema that appreciates the nostalgia of an earlier time.

Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS:

That’s nonsense, Fräulein. We Germans are looking forward, not backward. That era of German cinema is dead. The German cinema I create will not only be the cinema of Europe, but

the world’s only alternative to the degenerate Jewish influence of

Hollywood.

Fredrick jumps in . . .

FREDRICK:

Along with being a cinema owner, Emmanuelle is quite a formidable

film critic.

He chuckles, but alone.

GOEBBELS:

So it would appear. Unfortunately for the Fräulein, I’ve outlawed film criticism.

Zoller, thinking fast, says:

FREDRICK:

Why don’t you screen “Lucky Kids”? I’m sure Emmanuelle hasn’t seen it. And it’s so funny. I’ve been meaning to recommend it to her, for her German night. That’s a great idea. Let’s watch “Lucky Kids” tonight.

GOEBBELS:

Ahhh, “Lucky Kids,” “Lucky Kids,” “Lucky Kids.” When all is said and

done, my most purely enjoyable production. Not only that, I

wouldn’t be surprised if sixty years from now, it’s “Lucky Kids” that I’m the most remembered for.

I know it doesn’t seem like it now, but mark my words.

Very well, I’ll have a print sent over to the Fräulein’s cinema. We’ll screen “Lucky Kids” tonight.

As Francesca interprets this for Shosanna . . .

the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly filled with the bottom half of a gray S.S. officer uniform.

GOEBBELS:

Ah, Landa, you’re here. This is the young lady in question.

The S.S. officer sits down, and it’s our old friend from the first scene, COL. HANS LANDA.

FREDRICK:

Emmanuelle, this is Col. Hans Landa of the S.S. He’ll be running security for the premiere.

CU SHOSANNA:

A bomb is dropped and detonated behind her eyes. But if she gives any indication of this, her war story ends here.

The S.S. OFFICER

who murered her family takes her hand and kisses it, saying in perfect French:

COL. LANDA

Charmed, Mademoiselle.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Better known as “the Jew Hunter.”

The table laughs.

GOEBBELS:

Oh, Francesca, what was that funny thing the Führer said about Hans?

FRANCESCA:

What thing?

GOEBBELS:

You know, you were there. It was a funny thing the Führer said,

about Hans . . . something about a pig?

Francesca’s memory is jogged.

FRANCESCA:

Oh, yes, of course.

She repeats it by whispering it in Goebbels’s ear.

GOEBBELS:

Oh, yes, of course, that’s it. So the Führer said he wouldn’t be surprised if Hans weren’t rooting out Jews like a truffle pig from the playpen.

FRANCESCA:

That’s what we need, pigs that can root out Jews.

COL. LANDA

Who needs pigs when you have me?

Big, hearty laugh around the table.

GOEBBELS:

Do you have an engagement tonight?

COL. LANDA

Well, as a matter of fact, I do—

GOEBBELS:

—Break it. We’re all going to the fräulein’s cinema tonight to view

“Lucky Kids.”

COL. LANDA

Splendid.

Then the Reich minister’s companion, Mademoiselle Mondino, interrupts:

FRANCESCA:

And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels to his next appointment.

GOEBBELS:

Slave driver! French slave driver!

They all chuckle.

Everybody begins to stand up from the table . . .

Francesca gathers the stupid dogs . . .

As Col. Landa stands, he says:

COL. LANDA

Actually, in my role as security

chief of this joyous German occasion, I’m afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.

Mademoiselle Mimieux’s eyes go to Private Zoller, who responds.

FREDRICK:

What sort of discussion?

COL. LANDA

That sounded suspiciously like

a soldier questioning the order of a colonel? Or am I just being sensitive?

FREDRICK:

Nothing could be further from the truth, Colonel. Your authority is beyond question.

But your reputation precedes you. Should Mademoiselle Mimieux or myself be concerned?

GOEBBELS:

Hans, the boy means no harm, he’s simply smitten. And he’s correct. Your reputation does precede you.

Laughter all around. The Reich minister and his Axis entourage make their way to front of the café, with the two dumb dogs on

a leash, leading the way.

COL. LANDA No need for concern, you two.

As security chief, I simply need to have a chat with the possible new venue’s property owner.

FREDRICK:

I was just hoping to escort Mademoiselle Mimieux back to her cinema.

GOEBBELS:

Nonsense! You can eat ice cream and walk along the Seine another time. Right now, allow Col. Landa to do his job.

Everybody says their farewells.

Col. Landa offers the young Jew in hiding a seat at a small table in the outside patio area of Maxim’s.

The fluency and poetic proficiency of the S.S. Jew hunter’s French reveals to the audience that his feigning clumsiness at French with Monsieur LaPadite in the film’s first scene was simply an interrogation technique.

They speak FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA

Have you tried the strudel here?

SHOSANNA:

No.

COL. LANDA

It’s not so terrible. So how is it the young private and yourself came to be acquainted?

She’s about to answer when a WAITER approaches.

COL. LANDA

Yes, two strudels, one for myself and one for the mademoiselle. A cup of espresso, with a container of steamed milk on the side.

For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk.

Considering that Shosanna grew up on a dairy farm, and the last time she was on a dairy farm her strudel companion murdered her entire family, his ordering her milk is, to say the

least . . . disconcerting.

The key to Col. Landa’s power and/or charm, depending on the side one’s on, lies in his ability to convince you he’s privy to your secrets.

The waiter exits.

COL. LANDA

So, Mademoiselle, you were beginning to explain . . . ?

SHOSANNA:

(anxiously) Up until a couple of days ago,

I had no knowledge of Private Zoller or his exploits. To me, the private

was simply just a patron of my cinema. We spoke a few times, but—

COL. LANDA

—Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you. This is a simple formality, no

reason for you to feel anxious.

The strudel arrives.

The colonel takes one look at it and says to the waiter:

COL. LANDA

I apologize. I forgot to order the crème fraîche.

WAITER:

One moment.

He exits.

COL. LANDA

(referring to

the crème.)

Wait for the crème

(back to

business)

So, Emmanuelle—May I call you Emmanuelle?

SHOSANNA:

Oui.

COL. LANDA

So, Emmanuelle, explain to me how does it happen that a young lady such as yourself comes to own a cinema?

The waiter returns, applying crème fraîche to the two strudels.

The S.S. colonel looks across the table at his companion. Picking up his fork, he says:

COL. LANDA

After you.

Shosanna takes a whipped-creamy bite of strudel. Landa follows her lead.

COL. LANDA

(mouthful

of strudel)

Success?

Shosanna, mouth full of strudel, indicates she approves.

COL. LANDA Like I said, not so terrible.

(back to

business)

So you were explaining the origin of your cinema ownership?

SHOSANNA:

The cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle—

Col. Landa removes a little black book from his pocket.

COL. LANDA

—What are their names?

SHOSANNA:

Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.

He records the names in his little book.

COL. LANDA

Where are they now?

SHOSANNA:

My uncle was killed during the blitzkrieg.

COL. LANDA

Pity . . . Continue.

SHOSANNA:

Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring.

COL. LANDA

Regrettable.

(respectful

pause)

It’s come to my attention you have

a negro in your employ. Is that true?

SHOSANNA:

Yes, he’s a Frenchman. His name is Marcel. He worked with my aunt and

uncle since they opened the cinema. He’s the only other one who works with me.

COL. LANDA

Doing what?

SHOSANNA:

Projectionist.

COL. LANDA

Is he any good?

SHOSANNA:

The best.

COL. LANDA

Actually, one could see where that might be a good trade for them. Can you operate the projectors?

SHOSANNA:

Of course I can.

COL. LANDA

Knowing the Reich Minister as I do, I’m quite positive he wouldn’t want

the success or failure of his illustrious evening dependent on

the prowess of a negro. So if it comes to pass that we hold this event at your venue—talented, no doubt,

as your negro may be—you will

operate the projectors. Is that acceptable?

As if she has any say.

SHOSANNA:

Oui.

Col. Landa takes another bite of strudel, and Shosanna follows suit.

COL. LANDA

So it would appear our young hero is quite smitten with you?

SHOSANNA:

Private Zoller’s feelings for me aren’t of a romantic nature.

COL. LANDA

Mademoiselle . . . ?

SHOSANNA:

Colonel, his feelings are not romantic. I remind him of his sister.

COL. LANDA

That doesn’t mean his feelings aren’t romantic.

SHOSANNA:

I remind him of his sister who raised him.

COL. LANDA

It’s sounding more and more romantic by the minute.

Landa takes out a handsome-looking cigarette case, with an S.S. LOGO on it. Removing one of the fags, he lights it up with a fancy S.S. gold lighter. He offers one to Shosanna.

COL. LANDA

Cigarette?

SHOSANNA:

No, thank you.

COL. LANDA

Do you smoke?

SHOSANNA:

Yes.

COL. LANDA

Then I insist, you must take one. They’re not French, they’re German.

I hope you’re not nationalist about

your tobacco. To me, French cigarettes are a sin against nicotine.

She takes one but makes no move to light it.

He inhales deeply and says:

COL. LANDA

I did have something else I wanted to ask you, but right now, for the

life of me, I can’t remember what it is. Oh, well, must not have been important.

Col. Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table, puts on his gray S.S. cap, touches his finger to his visor, saluting Shosanna, and says:

COL. LANDA

Till tonight.

And with that he’s gone.

Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief.

The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her feet and ankles and the floor. We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine. During her conversation and strudel with the man who exterminated her entire family, Shosanna pissed herself.

She drops the German cigarette into the piss puddle by her feet.

INT—CINEMA AUDITORIUM—NIGHT

The SILVER SCREEN

Onscreen is the German screwball comedy “LUCKY KIDS.”

We hear OFFSCREEN laughter at the onscreen Aryan antics.

CU GOEBBELS:

watching the screen, basking in his own toxic genius.

CU FRANCESCA:

laughing at the comedy, hand covering her mouth.

CU TWO BLACK POODLES

pantingly watching the screen.

CU MAJOR HELLSTROM

smiling, smoking a German cigarette.

CU COL LANDA:

smoking a German cigarette, amused.

CU FREDRICK ZOLLER truly enjoying himself.

CU SHOSANNA:

watching the screen.

The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.

NARRATOR (VO)

While Shosanna sits there pretending

to be amused by the Aryan antics of Goebbel’s Frank Capra copy “Lucky

Kids,” a thought suddenly comes to her.

We see her face get slightly distracted behind the eyes.

NARRATOR (VO)

What if tonight, accidently, the

cinema burned down? The Third Reich would lose its minister of

propaganda, its national hero, and its top Jew hunter, all in one fell swoop.

She chuckles at THAT thought, though it looks like she’s chuckling at the German comedy.

NARRATOR (VO)

But then that thought . . .

. . . led Shosanna To a crazy idea.

The idea flashes on her face.

Then Shosanna bursts out laughing.

Zoller looks over at her. Happy.

She’s enjoying the movie.

SILVER SCREEN:

“The END” card for “Lucky Kids” is projected.

The Nazi rouges’ gallery, and Shosanna, applaud the film.

The lights go up.

Goebbels accepts congratulations, as they stand and begin to file out into the lobby.

NARRATOR (VO)

The screening of “Lucky Kids” was a complete success. And Herr Goebbels conceded to have the venue changed

to Shosanna’s cinema. Not only that,

in a moment of inspiration, Herr Goebbels had an idea.

Goebbels speaks GERMAN, and Francesca translates:

GOEBBELS:

I must say, I appreciate the modesty of this auditorium. Your cinema

has real respect, almost churchlike. Not to say we couldn’t spruce the place up a bit. In Versailles there’s a crystal chandelier hanging in the banquet hall that is extraordinary. We’re going to get it and hang it from the very middle of

the auditorium roof. Also I want to go to the Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes,

and just scatter them about the lobby.

MONTAGE:

We see a quick series of shots that show all that happening.

The chandelier being removed from the ceiling of Versailles.

Greek nude statues being hand-trucked out of the Louvre.

A truck driving through the French countryside with the enormous crystal chandelier in the back.

The lobby of Shosanna’s cinema, pimped out in Nazi iconography. WORKERS buzz around decorating. The Greek statues are moved into place.

We see workers trying with incredible difficulty to hoist the huge, heavy, and twinkingly fragile chandelier in Shosanna’s auditorium, which now resembles something out of one of Tinto Brass’s Italian B-movie ripoffs of Visconti’s “The Damned.”

SHOSANNA:

watches all this from an opera box. She shakes her head in disbelief.

BACK TO SHOSANNA AND THE NAZIS

in the lobby, post screening of “Lucky Kids.” She’s soundlessly escorting them to the door as they make their good-byes.

NARRATOR (VO) As they left the little French cinema that night, all the Germans were very happy . . .

We see Pvt. Zoller hanging back, so he can say good-bye.

NARRATOR (VO)

None more so than Fredrick Zoller.

She closes the door on him, watching the Nazis walk into Paris night. Their shadows for a moment on the wall, look like grotesque Nazi caricatures.

The Nazis are gone.

Marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby, looking down at Shosanna.

They speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

MARCEL:

What the fuck are we supposed to do?

SHOSANNA:

It looks like we’re supposed to have a Nazi premiere.

MARCEL:

Like I said, what the fuck are we supposed to do?

SHOSANNA:

Well, I need to speak with you about that.

MARCEL:

About what?

SHOSANNA:

About these Hun swine, commandeering our cinema.

MARCEL:

What about it?

She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel. She makes him part his legs and sits on the lower step, between his legs, her

back up against his chest, his arms around her shoulders, Shosanna has only known this type of intimacy with Marcel.

SHOSANNA:

Well, when I was watching that Boche (said in English)

Capra-corn abomination, (back to French)

I got an idea.

MARCEL:

I’m confused. What are we talking about?

SHOSANNA:

Filling the cinema with Nazis and their whores, and burning it down to the ground.

MARCEL:

I’m not talking about that. You’re talking about that.

SHOSANNA:

No, we’re talking about that, right now. If we can keep this place from burning down by ourselves, we can burn it down by ourselves.

MARCEL:

Shosanna—

SHOSANNA:

No, Marcel, just for the sake of argument, if we wanted to burn down the cinema

for any number of reasons, you and I could physically accomplish that, no?

MARCEL:

Oui, Shosanna, we could do that.

SHOSANNA:

And with Madame Mimieux’s three hundred and fifty nitrate film print collection,

we wouldn’t even need explosives, would we?

MARCEL:

You mean we wouldn’t need any more explosives?

SHOSANNA:

Oui, that’s exactly what I mean.

She begins kissing his hands.

SHOSANNA:

(CON’T)

I am going to burn down the cinema on Nazi night.

One of his fingers probes her mouth.

SHOSANNA:

(CON’T)

And if I’m going to burn down the cinema, which I am, we both know

you’re not going to let me do it by myself.

The back of her head presses up hard against him, as his hand both caresses and grips her lovely neck.

SHOSANNA:

(CON’T)

Because you love me. And I love you.

And you’re the only person on this earth I can trust.

She then TWISTS around so she’s straddling him. They are now face to face.

SHOSANNA:

(CON’T)

But that’s not all we’re going to do. Does the filmmaking equipment in the attic still work? I know the film

camera does. How about the sound recorder?

MARCEL:

Quite well, actually. I recorded a new guitarist I met in a café last week. It works superb. Why do we need filmmaking equipment?

SHOSANNA:

Because Marcel, my sweet, we’re going to make a film. Just for the Nazis.

She gives him a deep French kiss.

FADE TO BLACK:

BLACK FRAME:

CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:

CHAPTER FOUR:

“OPERATION KINO”

FADE OFF:

INT—ENGLISH COUNTRY ESTATE—DAY

A young MILITARY ATTACHÉ opens the sliding double doors that serve as an entrance to the room.

MILITARY ATTACHÉ

Right this way, Lieutenant.

A snappy, handsome British lieutenant in dress brown steps inside the room. This officer, who has been mixing it up with

the Gerrys since the late thirties, is LT. ARCHIE HICOX,

a young George Sanders type (“The Saint” and “Private Affairs of Bel Ami” years).

Upon entering the room, Lt. Hicox is gobsmacked.

Standing before him is legendary military mastermind

GEN. ED FENECH, an older George Sanders type (“Village of the Damned”).

But in the back of the room, sitting behind a piano, smoking his ever-present cigar, is the unmistakable bulk of WINSTON CHURCHILL.

The lieutenant was not expecting him.

Hicox salutes the general.

LT. HICOX

Lieutenant Hicox reporting, sir.

GEN. FENECH

(salutes back)

General Ed. Fenech. At ease, Hicox. Drink?

Hicox’s eyes go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano, who’s scrutinizing him behind his cigar. However, the man behind the cigar makes no gesture, and the general makes no acknowledgment of the three-hundred-pound gorilla in the room. Which Lt. Hicox knows enough to mean, if Churchill isn’t introduced, he ain’t there.

LT. HICOX

If you offered me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and

plain water.

GEN. FENECH

That a boy, Lieutenant. Make it yourself, like a good chap,

will you? Bar’s in the globe.

Hicox heads over to the bar globe.

LT. HICOX

Something for yourself, sir?

GEN. FENECH

Whiskey straight. No junk in it.

The lieutenant moves over to the Columbus-style globe bar and busies himself mixing spirits, playing bartender chappy.

Fenech, eyeing the lieutenant’s file.

GEN. FENECH It says here you’ve run three

undercover commando operations in Germany and German-occupied

territories? Frankfurt, Holland, and Norway, to be exact?

Back to them, mixing drinks, he says:

LT. HICOX

Extraordinary people, the Norwegians.

GEN. FENECH

It says here you speak German fluently?

LT. HICOX

Like a Katzenjammer Kid.

GEN. FENECH

And your occupation before the war?

His back still to us, as he bartends . . .

LT. HICOX

I’m a film critic.

GEN. FENECH

List your accomplishments?

LT. HICOX

Well, sir, such as they are, I write reviews and articles for a publication called “Films and Filmmakers.”

As well as our sister publication.

GEN. FENECH

What’s that called?

LT. HICOX

“Flickers Bi-Monthly,” and I’ve had two books published.

GEN. FENECH

Impressive. Don’t be modest, Lieutenant. What are their titles?

LT. HICOX

The first book was called “Art of the Eyes, the Heart, and the Mind: A Study of German Cinema in the Twenties.”

And the second one was called . . .

He turns around with his whiskey and plain water and the general’s whiskey no junk. He finishes what he was saying, as

he walks toward the general, handing him his drink.

LT. HICOX “Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci.” It’s a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G. W. Pabst.

He hands the general his whiskey.

LT. HICOX

What should we drink to, sir?

GEN. FENECH

(thinking, for

a moment)

Down with Hitler.

LT. HICOX

All the way down, sir.

CLINK.

GEN. FENECH

Are you familiar with German cinema under the

Third Reich?

LT. HICOX

Yes. Obviously I haven’t seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I am familiar with it.

GEN. FENECH

Explain it to me.

LT. HICOX

Pardon, sir?

GEN. FENECH

This little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German

film industry under the Third Reich. Explain to me UFA, under Goebbels?

LT. HICOX

Goebbels considers the films he’s making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema—an alternative to what he considers the Jewish

German intellectual cinema of the twenties and the Jewish-controlled

dogma of Hollywood.

SUDDENLY . . . bellowing from the back of the room:

CHURCHILL:

How’s he doing?

LT. HICOX

Frightfully sorry, sir, once again?

CHURCHILL:

You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game? Compared to, say,

. . . Louis B. Mayer . . . how’s he doing?

LT. HICOX

Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels

has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the

last eight years. But Louis B. Mayer wouldn’t be Goebbels’ proper opposite number. I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.

Gen. Fenech looks to the prime minister.

With a puff of cigar smoke, Churchill says:

CHURCHILL:

Brief him.

GEN. FENECH

Lt. Hicox, at this point in time I’d like to brief you on Operation Kino. Three days from now, Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris—

LT. HICOX

—What film, sir?

The general has to resort to peeking at his file.

GEN. FENECH

The motion pictures called “Nation’s Pride.”

LT. HICOX

Oh, you mean the film about Private Zoller?

GEN. FENECH

We don’t have any intelligence on exactly what the film that night

will be about.

LT. HICOX

But it’s called “Nation’s Pride”?

GEN. FENECH

Yes.

LT. HICOX

I can tell you what it’s about.

It’s about Private Fredrick Zoller.

He’s the German Sargeant York.

Fenech can’t help suppress a smile. They have the right man.

GEN. FENECH

In attendance at this joyous Germanic occasion will be Goebbels, Goering, Boormann, and most of the German High Command, including all the high-ranking officers of both the S.S. and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda-film industry.

LT. HICOX

The master race at play, aye?

GEN. FENECH

Basically, we have all our rotten

eggs in one basket. The objective of Operation Kino . . . Blow up the basket.

LT. HICOX

(reciting a

poem)

. . . and like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth. Jolly good, sir.

GEN. FENECH

An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines

will be your assist. The Germans call them “the Basterds.”

LT. HICOX

“The Basterds.” Never heard of them.

GEN. FENECH

Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.

But the Gerrys have heard of them, because

these Yanks have

been them

the devil. Their

leader is

a chap

named Lieutenant

Aldo Raine. The

Germans call him

“Aldo the

Apache.”

LT. HICOX

Why do they call

him that?

GEN. FENECH

Best guess is because he removes the scalps of the Nazi dead.

LT. HICOX

Scalps, sir?

GEN. FENECH

The hair.

He runs his finger along his hairline.

GEN. FENECH

Like a red Injun.

LT. HICOX

Rather gruesome-sounding little dickybird, isn’t he?

GEN. FENECH

No doubt the whole lot, a bunch of nutters. But you’ve heard the

expression “It takes a thief.”

LT. HICOX

Indeed.

Gen. Fenech continues on with his exposition, moving over to a military map.

GEN. FENECH

You’ll be dropped into Franch about twenty-four kilometers outside of Paris. The Basterds will be waiting for you. First thing, you go to a little village called Nadine.

(He points it out on the map.)

Apparently the Gerrys never go there. In Nadine, there’s a tavern called La Louisiane. You’ll rendezvous

with our double agent, and she’ll take it from there. She’s the one who’s

going to get you into the premiere. It will be you, her, and two German- born members of the Basterds. She’s

also made all the other arrangements you’re going to need.

LT. HICOX

How will I know her?

GEN. FENECH

I suspect that won’t be too much

trouble for you. Your contract is Bridget von Hammersmark.

LT. HICOX

Bridget von Hammersmark? The German movie star is working for England?

GEN. FENECH

For the last two years now. One could even say Operation Kino was her brainchild.

In the back of the room the bulldog barks:

CHURCHILL:

Extraordinary woman.

LT. HICOX

Quite.

GEN. FENECH

You’ll go to the premiere as her escort, lucky devil. She’ll also have the premiere tickets for the other two. Got the gist?

LT. HICOX

I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.

The three British bulldogs laugh.

EXT—CINEMA ROOFTOP—DAY

Shosanna and Marcel are on the rooftop of their cinema literally making a movie.

Marcel is behind an old (even then) BOLEX 35MM MOVIE CAMERA, positioned low, looking up.

Shosanna, the camera subject, stands on boxes looking down into it.

A old-timey MICROPHONE is positioned out of frame.

As they always do, and always will, they speak FRENCH SUBTITLED into you know what.

MARCEL:

We need a sync mark.

SHOSANNA:

What is a sync mark?

MARCEL:

An action and noise put together, So we can sync up the picture and sound.

SHOSANNA:

How do we do that?

MARCEL:

Clap your hands.

She does.

MARCEL:

In frame, imbecile.

She claps her hands in front of her face.

MARCEL:

Ready?

Shosanna takes a deep breath, then:

SHOSANNA:

Ready.

MARCEL:

Action.

WE CUT, BEFORE SHE SPEAKS, TO . . .

THE SCENE EARLIER BETWEEN MARCEL AND SHOSANNA IN THE

LOBBY, ON THE STAIRS, TALKING ABOUT BURNING DOWN THE CINEMA.

Big difference. This time, it’s in COLOR.

MARCEL:

But how do we get it developed?

Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop that footage. How do we get

a 35mm print with a soundtrack?

SHOSANNA:

Do you know one person who can do both things?

MARCEL:

Of course, Gaspar. Very nice man,

took care of all the experimental filmmakers. But nobody in their

right mind would strike a print of what you’re talking about. If the Nazis found out, their life wouldn’t be worth this.

He snaps his fingers.

SHOSANNA:

In a wolf fight, you either eat the

wolf or the wolf eats you. If we’re going to obliterate the Nazis,

we have to use their tactics.

MARCEL:

What does that mean?

SHOSANNA:

We find somebody who can develop and process a 35mm print. And we make them do it or we kill them.

Once we tell them what we want to do if they refuse, we have to kill them anyway or they’ll turn us in.

MARCEL:

Would you do that?

SHOSANNA:

Like that.

Snaps her fingers.

INT—SMALL FILM-PROCESSING LAB—LATE NIGHT

Aold mom-and-pop film processing lab circa the thirties. Late late at night.

GASPAR, the fatherly figure of all the experimental French filmmakers in the decade before German rule, takes a SAVAGE BEATING at the hands of his friend Marcel.

Shosanna watches, pitiless.

SHOSANNA:

Bring that fucker over here!

Put his head down on that table.

Marcel holds Gaspar’s arm behind him as he forces his head flat against the tabletop.

Shosanna brings a HATCHET DOWN DEEP into the table, just by his face.

SHOSANNA:

You either do what the fuck we tell you to, or I’ll bury this ax in your collaborating skull.

GASPAR:

I’m not a collaborator!

SHOSANNA:

Then prove it! Or does your manhood

go no deeper than standing to piss? Marcel, do his wife and children

know you?

MARCEL:

Oui.

SHOSANNA:

Then after we kill this dog for

Germans, we’ll go and silence them.

She lifts up the hatchet, raises it high . . .

SHOSANNA:

Prepare to die, collaborator fucker!

CUT TO:

GASPAR:

hands the couple a SMALL SILVER CAN OF 35MM FILM, Outside the shop window, it’s morning.

INT—PROJECTION ROOM

WE SEE the five heavy silver film cans of Fredrick Zoller’s life story, “Nation’s Pride” (clearly marked), on the floor of the projection booth.

The can for REEL 4 is open and empty.

Shosanna’s at the editing bench. REEL 4 is up on the rewinds . . .

Shosanna SPLICES her and Marcel’s footage into REEL 4 of Fredrick’s film, rewinds it, puts it back in the can, and

puts a piece of RED TAPE on the REEL 4 CAN.

She walks out of the booth, turning off the lights behind her, PLUNGING THE SCREEN INTO DARKNESS.

BLACK FRAME:

FROM BLACK DISSOLVE TO

EXT—LA LOUISIANE (TAVERN)—NIGHT

We see a small basement tavern with an old rustic sign out front that reads “La Louisiane.”

A SUBTITLE APPEARS:

“The village of Nadine, France”

TWO SHOT LT. HICOX and LT. ALDO RAINE

Aldo is dressed like a French civilian. Hicox is dressed in a German gray S.S. captain’s uniform. They look out of a window, in an apartment, in the village of Nadine, overlooking the tavern.

LT. ALDO

You didn’t say the goddamn rendezvous was in a fuckin’ basement.

LT. HICOX

I didn’t know.

LT. ALDO

You said it was in a tavern?

LT. HICOX

It is a tavern.

LT. ALDO

Yeah, in a basement. You know, fightin’ in a basement offers a lot of difficulties, number one being you’re fighting in a basement.

Wilhelm Wicki joins the SHOT, dressed in a German S.S. lieutenant’s uniform.

WICKI:

What if we go in there and she’s not even there?

LT. HICOX

We wait. Don’t worry. She’s a British spy.

She’ll make the rendezvous.

WE SEE that the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes, are in the room as well. They are Donowitz, Hirschberg,

and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the gray uniform of an S.S. lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself, sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt, looped around his boot. Anybody not in the scene from the Basterd’s opening chapter is dead.

Lt. Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of the room SHARPENING his dagger menacingly.

Stiglitz is fucking weird . . .

Lt. Hicox approaches Stiglitz . . .

LT. HICOX

Stiglitz, right?

STIGLITZ:

That’s right, sir.

He continues bringing the blade’s edge up, then down on the leather strap.

LT. HICOX

I hear you’re pretty good with that?

Meaning the blade.

Stiglitz doesn’t answer.

LT. HICOX

You know, we’re not looking for trouble right now. We’re simply making contact with our agent.

Should be uneventful. However, on

the off chance I’m wrong and things prove eventful, I need to know we can all remain calm.

The renegade Gerry sergeant stops his blade’s progress and looks up at the limey lieutenant.

STIGLITZ:

I don’t look calm to you?

LT. HICOX

Well, now you put it like that, I guess you do.

He turns his attention back to his blade.

Hicox moves over to Aldo and asks him privately:

LT. HICOX

This Gerry of yours, Stiglitz? Not exactly the loquacious type, is he?

Aldo just looks at him.

LT. ALDO

Is that the kinda man you need, the loquacious type?

LT. HICOX

Fair point, Lieutenant.

LT. ALDO

So y’all git in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?

Make bets on how it all comes out?

LT. HICOX

If we get into trouble, we can handle it. But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn

sure no Germans or French, for that matter— escape from that basement.

If Fräulein von Hammersmark’s cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.

Donny chimes in:

SGT. DONOWITZ

Speaking of Fräulein von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the death trap rendezvous?

LT. HICOX

She chose the spot.

SGT. DONOWITZ

Well, isn’t that just dandy?

LT. HICOX

Look, she’s not a military strategist. She’s just an actress.

LT. ALDO Ya don’t got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don’t want to fight in a basement.

LT. HICOX

She wasn’t picking a place to fight. She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.

PFC. HIRSCHBERG

Lieutenant, I hate to be contrary, but I got me a Nazi pissin’ on Louisiana two o’clock.

They move to the window, and sure enough, ONE LONE NAZI PRIVATE relieves himself against the side wall.

Lt. Hicox, this was definitely not the plan.

LT. HICOX

Shit.

Sgt. Donowitz chides him:

SGT. DONOWITZ

So what do you think your Fräulein von Hammer—

LT. HICOX

—Obviously, I don’t know, Sergeant.

The British officer watches the German soldier, who’s not supposed to be there. When Hugo Stiglitz joins him at the window, Stiglitz looks down at the urinating Nazi, S.S. dagger in hand.

STIGLITZ:

If we’re going, let’s go.

He sheaths the dagger.

EXT—LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)—NIGHT

The GERMAN PISSING PRIVATE sloppily finishes his task. Cramming his noodle back in his pants, he descends the stairs that lead him back into the basement tavern. We follow him . . .

INT—LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)—NIGHT

Inside the basement tavern La Louisiane. It has a very low-hanging basement ceiling. A old-looking wood bar off to the right. And the only other space in the little tavern is taken

up by two large (at least in here) tables, which take up both halves of the room. And despite rumors to the contrary, one of the two tables is completely filled with drunken, celebrating

Nazi enlisted men, of which our urinating friend is one of five.

FIVE NAZIS:

ONE GERMAN MASTER SERGEANT, ONE FEMALE GERMAN SERGEANT (a powerfully built, stocky type), and THREE MALE GERMAN SOLDIERS.

The five Nazis are sitting around the table, drinking, and playing a very fun game with none other than the Fräulein of the hour, UFA diva BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK, dressed to the

nines in a chic, forties-style woman’s suit, complete with fedora. The game they’re playing consists of each player having

a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary, stuck to their forehead. The player doesn’t know what name is on their forehead. So they ask the others questions to figure out who they are.

The five Germans’ five cards read: MASTER SGT #1: (POLA NEGRI);

FEMALE SGT #2:
(BEETHOVEN); GERMAN PRIVATE #3: (MATA HARI);

GERMAN PRIVATE #4: (EDGAR WALLACE); GERMAN PRIVATE #5: (WINNETOU). And Bridget von Hammersmark, who wears her card in

the brim of her fedora, has GENGHIS KHAN.

It’s German #5’s (WINNETOU) turn to ask questions.

The DIALOGUE will be in GERMAN and SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH.

WINNETOU:

. . . okay, I’m not German. Am I American?

The whole table bursts out laughing.

FEMALE SGT. BEETHOVEN

Yes, you are!

EDGAR WALLACE:

Well, not really.

SGT. POLA NEGRI What do you mean, not really? Of course he is.

EDGAR WALLACE:

Well, if he’s so American, how come he’s never been translated into

English. He’s not American. He’s supposed to be American, but he’s not

an American creation. In fact, he’s something very different.

WINNETOU:

Okay, I’m a fictional, literary character, from the past. I’m American, and that’s controversial.

BRIDGET/GENGUS

No, it’s not controversial. The nationality of the author has nothing to do with

the nationality of the character. The character is the character. Hamlet’s not British, he’s Danish. So, yes, this character was born in America.

WINNETOU:

Well, I’m glad that’s settled. If I had a wife, would she be called a squaw?

He’s got it.

The table laughs.

THE TABLE:

YES!

WINNETOU:

Is my blood brother Old Shatterhand?

THE TABLE:

Yes!

WINNETOU:

Did Karl May write me?

THE TABLE:

Yes!

In the BACKGROUND, WE SEE our three counterfeit German officers—Hicox, Wicki, and Stiglitz—enter the basement

tavern. They obviously see the five German soldiers, but they’re too far away for us (the audience) to read their faces. No doubt they’re less than happy. Fräuhlein von Hammersmark

sees them as well. Without getting up, she waves to them.

BRIDGET:

Hello, my lovelies. I will join you in moments. I’m finishing up a game with my five new friends here.

LT. HICOX

No hurry, Fräulein von Hammersmark.

Take your time. Enjoy yourself.

BRIDGET:

(to Winnetou)

So who are you?

WINNETOU:

I am WINNETOU, CHIEF of the APACHES!

The table CHEERS and APPLAUDS the Apache chief as he takes the card off his forehead.

The other four German soldiers drink down their beer (part of the game).

Bridget von Hammersmark knocks back her champagne.

MATA HARI:

Fräulein von Hammersmark, when your friends came in, did you realize

you did a double take, like in the movies?

BRIDGET:

Really? No, I wasn’t aware of that at all.

MATA HARI:

They must be second nature to you now. Did they teach you how to do a double take in the movies?

BRIDGET:

Well, yes, they did, but it’s not really that difficult.

SGT. POLA NEGRI

Do one for us.

The table heartily agrees.

Bridget looks directly at the master sergeant and does a perfect, and perfectly funny, double take.

The table loves it.

MATA HARI:

My turn, I want to try.

Mata Hari looks directly at Beethoven and does a double take.

EDGAR WALLACE:

I want to try.

He does.

Soon the whole table is doing dueling double takes.

HICOX—WICKI—STIGLITZ

watch the table do dueling double takes. Obviously, they don’t understand.

THEN . . .

Bridget von Hammersmark rises and excuses herself from the table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at the name for the first time. Genghis Khan.

BRIDGET:

Genghis Khan! I would never have gotten that.

She walks over and joins the masquerading Germans’ table. The gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a French cheek kiss, as if she knows them well.

They all take a seat. The two basterds and one Brit drink whiskey. The tavern’s PROPRIETOR, an older, big-bellied

Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table and pours more champagne into Bridget’s champagne glass. He leaves, returning back behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other person in the establishment.

Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

LT. HICOX

I thought this place was supposed to have more

French than Germans?

BRIDGET:

Normally that’s

true. The sergeant over there’s

wife just

had a

baby. His commanding officer

gave him and his

mates the

night

off to celebrate.

We should

leave.

WICKI:

BRIDGET:

No, we should stay. For one drink at least. I’ve been waiting for you in a bar. It would look strange if we left before we had a drink.

LT. HICOX

She’s right. Just be calm, and enjoy your booze.

BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE

The French barmaid has taken Bridget’s place in the rousing, rowdy game. She tells them her person must be French or she

won’t know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a name on a card. The barmaid puts it on her forehead. It says:

NAPOLEON.

The Germans all laugh.

BACK TO THE BASTERDS’ TABLE

BRIDGET:

There’s been some new developments.

The cinema venue has changed.

LT. HICOX

Why?

BRIDGET:

No one knows. But that in itself shouldn’t be a problem. The cinema

it’s been changed to is considerably smaller than The Ritz. So whatever materials you brought for The Ritz should be doubly effective here.

Now this next piece of information is colossal, try not to overreact.

The Führer will be attending tomorrow.

Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT-TAKE.

Bridget’s eyes bore holes in him.

BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS

They see Hugo do the spit-take and burst out laughing. Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit-takes, like they did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say, they all get wet.

BACK TO THE BASTERDS

BRIDGET:

(to Hicox)

You’ll be going as Ernst Schuller. You’ll say you’re an associate producer on Riefenstahl’s “Tiefland.” It’s the

one German production not under Goebbels’ control, and Leni wouldn’t be caught dead at a Goebbels film affair.

BACK TO THE REAL GERMAN TABLE

Master Sgt. Pola Negri drinks his beer as he looks over, dreamily, at Bridget von Hammersmark at the other table.

BACK TO THE BASTERDS

Bridget continues to brief Hicox on his identity. We see in

the B.G. the German master sergeant stand up from his table and head toward Fräulein von Hammersmark.

BRIDGET:

. . . the film’s gone through many delays, and Leni’s health is deteriorating, so if you have to speak . . .

Hicox, seeing the German master sergeant approach, signals for her to cool it.

SGT. POLA NEGRI

Fräulein von Hammersmark, I was just thinking, could you sign an autograph

to my son on his birthday?

BRIDGET:

I’d love to, Wilhelm.

(to the table)

This handsome happy sergeant just became a father today.

The pretend officers offer congratulations to the sergeant.

The German master sergeant CLICKS his heels and bows before his superior officers.

SGT. POLA NEGRI

Thank you. Heil Hitler.

He raises his hand . . . as do the seated phony officers: “Heil Hitler.”

As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch . . .

BRIDGET:

So, Wilhelm, do you know the name of this progeny yet?

SGT. POLA NEGRI

I most certainly do, Fräulein. His name is Maximilian.

Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz likes this German sergeant.

STIGLITZ:

Wonderful name, Sergeant.

SGT. POLA NEGRI

Thank you, Lieutenant. When he’s old enough to ride a bicycle, I will buy

him a blue one. And I will paint on the side “The Blue Max.”

He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheer.

They do.

Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish.

BRIDGET:

There you go. But wait, I’m not finished yet.

She reaches into her clutch and pulls out some lipstick, applies some ruby-red color to her lips, and then kisses the napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then she hands the treasured item to the young officer.

BRIDGET:

Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.

SGT. POLA NEGRI

Thank you, Fräulein, thank you. Max may not know who you are now. But he will.

I will show him all of your movies. He will grow up with your films, and this napkin on his wall.

Then, to the whole tavern . . .

SGT. POLA NEGRI

I propose a toast to the greatest actress in

Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is no

Riefenstahl, only von Hammersmark!

The whole room toasts.

This would be a good time for the German sergeant to go back to his table and his men. And he almost does . . . but . . . since he is drunk, and star struck, he out wears his welcome.

SGT. POLA NEGRI

So, Fräulein von Hammersmark, what brings you to France?

Feeling any good Nazi officer’s patience would have been exhausted long ago, Lt. Hicox butts in.

LT. HICOX

None of your business, Sergeant.

You might not have worn out your welcome with the fräulein with your drunken, boorish behavior, but you have worn out your welcome with me.

The table of game-playing soldiers hears this and gets quiet.

LT. HICOX

Might I remind you Sergeant, you’re an enlisted man. This is an officers’ table. I suggest

you stop pestering the fräulein and rejoin your table.

The German master sergeant looks quizzically at the officer.

SGT. POLA NEGRI

Excuse me, Captain, but your accent is very unusual.

The whole room pauses . . . for different reasons . . .

SGT. POLA NEGRI

Where are you from?

A silent moment passes between the two tables, then the two German- born imposters spring into action.

WICKI:

Sergeant! You must be either drunk or mad to speak to a superior officer with

such impertinence!

Stiglitz, STANDS and YELLS to the other table:

STIGLITZ:

I’m making YOU . . .

(pointing at

Winnetou)

. . . and YOU . . .

(pointing at

Edgar Wallace)

. . . responsible for him. (pointing at

Sgt. Pola)

I suggest you take hold of your friend, or he’ll spend Max’s first birthday

in jail for public drunkenness!

The Germans SPRING UP and take hold of Sgt. Pola . . .

WHEN . . .

A GERMAN VOICE rings out:

GERMAN VOICE (OS)

Then might I inquire?

The five known Germans move aside, revealing the unknown German in the room, unseen till now, our old friend from before:

MAJOR DIETER HELLSTROM of the GESTAPO. The major stands from the little table he was sitting at.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Like the young, newly christened father, I to have an acute ear for accents.

And like him, I too find yours odd. From where do you hail, Captain?

Wicki jumps in:

WICKI:

Major, this is highly inappr—

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

—I wasn’t speaking to you, Lieutenant Saltzberg,

(turning to

Stiglitz)

or you either, Lieutenant Berlin. (looking at

Hicox)

I was speaking to Captain I-don’t-know-what.

The Gestapo major is now standing beside Sgt. Pola, before the imposter’s table.

Lt. Hicox calmly explains his origin.

LT. HICOX

I was born in the village that rests in the shadow of Pitz Palu.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

The mountain?

LT. HICOX

Yes. In that village we all speak like this.

Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Yes.

LT. HICOX

Then you saw me. You remember the skiing torch scene?

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Yes, I do.

LT. HICOX

In that scene were myself, my father,

my sister, and my two brothers. My brother is so handsome, the director, Pabst, gave him a closeup.

As Bridget von Hammersmark places a cigarette in an ivory cigarette holder—which Hicox, as if on cue, lights for her

she says:

BRIDGET:

Major, if my word means anything, I can vouch for everything the young captain has just said. He does hail from the bottom of Pitz Palu, he was in the film, and his brother is far more handsome than he.

The imposters laugh.

Then . . . so does the Gestapo major. He turns to the sergeant.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

You should rejoin your friends.

Which the young sergeant is more than happy to do. That table begins playing their game again.

Major Hellstrom, the highest-ranking officer in the room, bows graciously to the female German celebrity.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

May I join you?

BRIDGET:

By all means, Major.

The Gestapo major sits at the table, opposite Lt. Hicox and Wicki. The French barmaid brings over the Major’s beer stein.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

So that’s the source of your bizarre accent? Extraordinary. So what are

you doing here, Captain?

LT. HICOX

Aside from having a drink with the lovely fräulein?

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Well, that pleasure requires no explanation.

Chuckle . . . chuckle

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

I mean in country. You’re obviously not stationed in France, or I’d know who you are.

LT. HICOX

You know every German in France?

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Worth knowing.

LT. HICOX

Well, therein lies the problem. We never claimed to be worth knowing.

Chuckle . . . chuckle.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

(chuckling as

he asks)

All levity aside, what are you doing in France?

LT. HICOX

Attending Goebbels’s film premiere as the fräulein’s escort.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

You’re the fräulein’s escort?

LT. HICOX

Somebody has to carry the lighter.

Chuckle . . . chuckle.

BRIDGET:

The captain is my date, but all three are my guests. We’re old friends, Major, who go back a long time. Longer than

an actress would care to admit.

Chuckle . . . chuckle.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Well, in that case, let me raise a glass to the three luckiest men in the room.

BRIDGET:

I’ll drink to that.

They cheers.

BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS’ TABLE

They continue to have a lot of fun playing their game.

BACK TO THE OFFICERS’ TABLE

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

I must say, that game they’re playing looks like a good bit of fun. I didn’t

join them, because you’re quite right, Captain, officers and enlisted men shouldn’t fraternize. But seeing as we’re all

officers here,

(bowing to

Bridget)

. . . and sophisticated lady friends of officers, what say we play the game?

Lt. Hicox begins to refuse when Bridget (feeling she knows better) interrupts him:

BRIDGET:

Okay, one game.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Wunderbar.

The major borrows five cards from the other table and lays them out in front of Bridget and the officers.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

So the object of the game is to write

the name of a famous person on your card. Real or fictitious, doesn’t matter. For instance, you could write Confucius or

Fu Manchu.

(He SNAPS his fingers.) Eric! More pens.

(back to the players)

And they must be famous. No Aunt Ingas. When you finish writing, put the card face down on the table and move it to the person to your left. The person to your right will move their card in

front of you. You pick up the card without looking at it, lick the back, and stick it on your forehead, like so.

He demonstrates.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

(con’t)

And in ten yes or no questions, you must guess who you are . . .

As Maj. Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the game, a CAMERA PANS OFF HIM and BEGINS SLOWLY ZOOMING INTO STIGLITZ. The major’s dialogue begins to FADE AWAY.

Until we’re in a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK. Which is RED-FILTERED FOOTAGE of Hugo being savagely WHIPPED by somebody wearing a GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSEUP.

The flashback disappears. It’s driving Stiglitz crazy, being this close to a Gestapo uniform and not plunging a knife into it.

The major’s voice comes back on the soundtrack.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

. . . So let’s give it a try, shall we? Everybody write your names.

The five players write their names . . .

Then move their cards to the left . . .

Everybody sticks their cards on their forehead . . .

MAJOR:

BRIDGET:

WILHELM:

ARCHIE:

HUGO:

HELLSTROM:

VON HAMMERSMARK:

WICKI:

HICOX:

STIGLITZ:

is

KING:

G.W.

BULLDOG:

BRIGITTE:

MARCO:

KONG:

PABST:

DRUMMOND:

HELM:

POLO:

MAJ. KING KONG

I’ll start, give you the idea.

Am I German?

They laugh.

BRIDGET:

No.

MAJ. KING KONG

Am I an American?

They laugh—but then Wicki says:

WICKI:

Wait a minute, he goes to—

BRIDGET:

Don’t be ridiculous. Obviously he wasn’t born in America.

MAJ. KING KONG

So . . . I visited America, aye?

The table says, “Yes.”

MAJ. KING KONG

Was this visit . . . fortuitous?

WICKI:

Not for you.

MAJ. KING KONG

. . . Hummm. My native land, is it what one would call exotic?

The table confers and decides, yes, it is exotic.

MAJ. KING KONG

Hummm. That could be either a reference to the jungle or the Orient. I’m going to let my first instinct take over and ask, am I from the jungle?

The table says, “Yes, you are.”

MAJ. KING KONG

Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask whether you’re real or fictitious.

I, however, think that’s too easy, so I won’t ask that, yet. Okay, my native land is the jungle. I visited America, but my visit was not fortuitous to me, but the implication is that it was to somebody else. When I went from the jungle to America, . . . did I go by boat?

“Yes.”

MAJ. KING KONG

Did I go against my will?

“Yes.”

MAJ. KING KONG

On this boat ride . . . Was I in chains?

“Yes.”

MAJ. KING KONG

When I arrived in America . . . was I displayed in chains?

“Yes.”

MAJ. KING KONG

Am I the story of the Negro in America?

The table says, “No.”

MAJ. KING KONG

Well, then, I must be King Kong.

He throws the card on the table.

They applaud him.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Now since I answered correctly, you all need to finish your drinks.

The three counterfeit Nazis knock back their whiskeys.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Now, who’s next?

LT. HICOX

Major, I don’t mean to be rude. But the four of us are very good friends. And the four of us haven’t seen each other in quite a while. So .

. .

Major, I’m afraid, you are intruding.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

I beg to differ, Captain. It’s only if the fräulein considers my presence an intrusion that I become an intruder.

How about it, Fräulein? Am I intruding?

BRIDGET:

Of course not, Major.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

I didn’t think so. It’s simply the young captain is immune to my charms.

The table’s not sure what to do. Is this a confrontation? Then the major laughs.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

I’m just joking. Of course, I’m intruding.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Allow me to refill your glasses, gentlemen, and I will bid you and the fräulein adieu.

(leaning in)

Eric has a bottle of thirty-three-year-old single-malt scotch whiskey from the Scottish highlands. What do you say, gentlemen?

LT. HICOX

You’re most gracious, sir.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Eric, the thirty-three and new glasses! You don’t want to contaminate the thirty-three with the swill you were drinking.

ERIC:

How many glasses?

LT. HICOX

Five glasses.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Not me. I like scotch, scotch doesn’t like me.

BRIDGET:

Nor I. I’ll stay with bubbly.

Lt. Hicox holds up three fingers (pinky to middle finger) to Eric, the owner.

LT. HICOX

Three glasses.

Eric brings the three glasses and the old bottle, pouring for the three soldiers.

Major Hellstrom lifts up his beer stein and toasts:

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

To a thousand-year Reich!

They all mutter, “a thousand-year reich” and clink glasses.

The Gestapo major puts down his beer stein, and then WE HEAR a CLICK under the table.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Did you hear that? That’s the sound of

my WALTER pointed right at your testicles.

LT. HICOX

Why do you have a Luger pointed at my testicles?

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Because you’ve just given yourself

away, captain. You’re no more German than scotch.

LT. HICOX

Well, Major—

BRIDGET:

—Major—

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

—Shut up, slut.

(to Hicox)

You were saying?

LT. HICOX

I was saying that makes two of us. I’ve had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.

SGT. STIGLITZ

That makes three of us.

UNDER THE TABLE:

We see all three guns pointed at the appropriate crotches, as well as Bridget’s legs, right besides the Nazi major’s. Her pretty gams are sure to be chewed up in the possible crossfire.

SGT. STIGLITZ

And at this range, I’m a real

Fredrick Zoller.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Hummm . . . Looks like we have a bit of a sticky situation here.

LT. HICOX

What’s going to happen, Major, is you’re going to stand up and walk out that

door with us.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

No, no,

no, no,

no, no,

I don’t think

so. I’m

afraid you

and I both know, no matter

what

happens

to

anybody else

in this room,

the two of

us aren’t going

anywhere.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

(pointing at the table

behind him)

Too bad about Sgt. Wilhelm and his friends.

If any of you expect to live, you’ll have to shoot them too.

(pause)

Looks like little Max is going to grow up an orphan. How sad.

BRIDGET:

Then, Major, I implore you. For the sake of those German troops, will you please leave with us?

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Oh, Bridget, your concern for German troops gets me . . .

(pointing at

his heart)

. . . right here. You mean for the sake of your whore legs, don’t you? You can’t afford to get any bullet holes in them. You’re not finished spreading them for all the Hollywood Jews.

Lt. Hicox picks up his thirty-three-year-old single-malt scotch and says:

LT. HICOX (ENGLISH)

Well, if this is it, old boy, I hope you don’t mind if I go out speaking the king’s?

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

(ENGLISH)

By all means, Captain.

The English film critic commando picks up the thirty-three the Nazi major bought him and says:

LT. HICOX

There’s a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good scotch.

And seeing as I might be rapping on the door momentarily . . .

He downs the stuff.

LT. HICOX

(to the Nazi

major)

I must say, damn good stuff, sir.

He puts the glass down.

LT. HICOX Now about this pickle we find

ourselves in. It would appear there’s only one thing left for you to do.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

(ENGLISH)

And what would that be?

LT. HICOX

Stiglitz.

STIGLITZ:

Say, “auf Widersehen” to your balls!

STIGLITZ:

FIRES into HELLSTROM’S BALLS . . .

As does HICOX, HITTING not only Hellstrom, but BRIDGET as well.

HELLSTROM:

FIRES into HICOX’s BALLS and KNEECAPS.

STIGLITZ:

then JUMPS over the table and begins STABBING HELLSTROM with the

DAGGER.

HICOX FALLS to the floor . . . DEAD.

BRIDGET FALLS to the floor . . . SHOT.

WICKI:

brings his weapon out from underneath the table and BEGINS

FIRING across at the GERMANS at the table, who, unaware, were still

PLAYING THE GAME.

WINNETOU:

is SHOT IN THE BACK, before he even knows what is happening.

EDGAR WALLACE is SHOT by WICKI.

SGT. POLA NEGRI

FALLS to the floor in the confusion.

FEMALE SGT. BEETHOVEN and STIGLITZ bring their guns toward each other and FIRE. They BOTH TAKE and GIVE each other so many BULLETS it’s almost romantic when they collapse DEAD on the

floor.

WICKI and MATA HARI

both ON THEIR FEET, FIRING WILDLY at each other. MATA HARI is HIT THREE TIMES. WICKI is HIT ONCE.

SGT. POLA NEGRI

comes off the floor with a SUBMACHINE GUN and SPRAYS the

whole other side of the room, WIPING OUT WICKI, ERIC, MATA HARI, and THE BARMAID.

The SHOOTING STOPS . . . THE SMOKE caused by the gunfire . . .

starts to DISSIPATE . . . The only one in the room left alive is the

young German sergeant with the machine gun.

WE HEAR the feet of the soldiers outside reach the basement entrance.

The door opens . . .

The German sergeant sends FIFTY BULLETS in the door’s direction . . .

No one goes through it.

What we have here is a rabbit-hole-like situation. No one inside is getting out. No one outside is getting in.

The young German sergeant YELLS in ENGLISH to the outside:

GERMAN SERGEANT:

You outside! Who are you? British, American, what?

Aldo’s voice YELLS down the hole:

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

We’re Americans! What are you?

GERMAN SERGEANT:

I’m a German, you idiot!

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

You speak English pretty good for a German!

GERMAN SERGEANT:

I agree! So let’s talk!

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Okay, talk!

GERMAN SERGEANT:

I’m a father! My baby was born today

in Frankfurt! Five hours ago! His name is Max! We were in here drinking and celebrating! They’re the ones that

came in shooting and killing! It’s not my fault!

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Okay, okay, it wasn’t your fault!

What’s your name, soldier?

GERMAN SERGEANT:

Wilhelm!

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

That’s the same name as one of the guys you just killed!

WILHELM:

They attacked us!

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Okay, Wilhelm . . . is anybody alive on our side?

WILHELM:

No!

We hear a VOICE OFFSCREEN yell out:

BRIDGET’S VOICE (OS)

I’m alive!

Wilhelm spins in the direction of the voice.

On the floor, with a bullet in her BLOODY LEG, lies the still-alive Bridget von Hammersmark.

The German sergeant points the muzzle of the machine gun at the German celebrity, with hate in his eyes.

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Who’s that?

WILHELM:

(to BRIDGET,

low)

Make a sound, whore, and I spit!

Meaning the muzzle.

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Wilhelm, who is that?

WILHELM:

Is the girl on your side?

Pause.

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Which girl?

WILHELM:

Who do you think—von Hammersmark!

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Yeah, she’s ours!

WILHELM:

(to Bridget,

LOW, in GERMAN)

I thought so. So you run with the Americans now, huh? Now times are

bad?

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Is she okay?

WILHELM:

(to Bridget,

LOW, in GERMAN)

You despicable traitor.

(to Aldo)

She’s been shot, but she’s alive. (to Bridget,

LOW, in GERMAN)

For now.

We hear the Basterds curse their luck offscreen.

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Okay, Wilhelm, what’d ya say we make a deal?

WILHELM:

What’s your name?

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Aldo. Wilhelm, can I call ya Willi?

WILHELM:

Yes.

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

So, Willi, you know we could lob three or four or five or six grenades down there and your little war story ends here. But good fer you, bad fer her.

You die, she dies. So what say we make a swap?

WILLI:

Keep talking!

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Okay, Willi, here’s my deal! You let me and one of my men come down to take the girl away! And we take the girl and leave! That simple, Willi!

You go your way, we go ours! And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy! So what ‘ya say, Willi, we got a deal?

Willi thinks . . .

Bridget watches Willi think . . .

WILLI:

Aldo?

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

I’m here, Willi!

WILLI:

I want to trust you . . . But how can I?

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

What choice ya got?

WILLI:

I could kill the girl!

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Well, now, Willi, that’s true enough. But something you need to know, so

you don’t get the wrong idea. Ain’t none of us give a fuck ‘bout that girl. But, admittedly, if you kill

her, it would fuck up our plans. But you’ll be dead by then anyway, so

what’d you care? And let’s not forget that little Katzenjammer Max, growin’ up without a pop. So in the spirit of gettin’ you home to him, we got a deal, Willi?

WILLI:

Okay, Aldo. I’m going to trust you!

Come down, no guns!

Aldo and Hirschberg come down the stairs, showing open hands.

Willi keeps his machine gun trained on them.

Aldo, with his hands up, says:

ALDO:

Hey, Willi, what’s with the machine gun? I thought we had a deal.

WILLI:

We do have a deal. Now get the girl and go.

ALDO:

Not so fast, Willi. We only have a

deal, we trust each other. A Mexican standoff ain’t trust.

WILLI:

You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.

ALDO:

You got guns on us, you decide to

shoot, we’re dead. Up top, they got grenades, they drop ’em down here, you’re dead. That’s a Mexican

standoff, and that wasn’t the deal.

WILLI:

Just take that fuckin’ traitor and go! See? Now you’re down here— Now you get tricky—!

ALDO:

—No tricks!—Ain’t nobody gittin’ tricky, Willi! I swear to god, I’m too damn dumb to get tricky. But

(meaning

Hirschberg)

him and I lived up to the deal. We came down without guns. Now it’s your turn. No trust, no deal.

Willi pointing the gun at them . . . thinking . . .

ALDO:

I know you’re scared. I’m scared, he’s scared, we’re all scared.

So what’s it gonna be, Willi? Either we got a deal or you might as well just shoot us now.

Willi decides . . .

He puts the machine gun down on the bar.

WILLI:

Fine. Take that fucking traitor and get her out of my sight.

ALDO:

Danke, Willi, danke. Okay, Hirschberg, you grab her shoulder—

WHEN . . .

From behind Aldo and Hirschberg, Bridget lifts up Major Hellstrom’s WALTER and EMPTIES the remaining bullets into

Sgt. Willi, who FALLS to the floor, DEAD.

Aldo and Hirschberg spin around, shocked.

From the floor, the bloody, sweaty, and in excruciating pain (she’ll probably lose that leg} German movie star says to the two American soldiers she’s just meeting for the first time:

BRIDGET:

He was an enemy soldier who knew who

I was. He couldn’t live.

INT—FRENCH HOUSE IN COUNTRY (BEDROOM)—NIGHT

An OLD MAN lies asleep under the covers of his blankets, in his bed, in his bedroom . . .

WHEN . . .

. . . .

OFF SCREEN the

sound of a DOOR BEING KICKED OPEN . . .

. . . .

. The

SOUND of

what sounds like EIGHT

DOGS BARKING . . .

and the

sound

of FEET RUNNING TOWARD US . . .

his bedroom door is THROWN OPEN, and Sgt. Donowitz RUSHES IN, grabbing the old man in his bed and putting a

.45 automatic to his head.

SGT. DONOWITZ

(ENGLISH)

Doctor? Doctor?

OLD MAN:

(FRENCH)

What? What’s happening?

Donny SLAMS the .45 hard against the old man’s head, shocking, scaring, and bringing the old gent to attention.

SGT. DONOWITZ

(ENGLISH)

Doctor? Are you a fucking doctor?

He nods his head, yes.

SGT. DONOWITZ

Andiamo . . .

Donny YANKS/DRAGS the old man out of bed, in his almost comical nightshirt (which makes him cuter, thus the brutality against him hurts more) toward the door . . .

INT—DOCTOR’S EXAMINING ROOM—NIGHT

. . . Into a doctor’s examining room built into a French country house, with an examining table and medical instruments.

However, it’s obviously the medical examining room of a veterinarian.

Along the walls are different cages with eight BARKING dogs in them.

The soldiers are putting the shot-in-the-leg, bleeding, and in excruciating pain Bridget on the examining table.

Donny, still holding onto the Old Man, points in the girl’s direction . . .

SGT. DONOWITZ

(ENGLISH)

She’s been shot. Shot. Bang, bang . . .

(pointing at

his leg)

. . . in leg . . . understand?

OLD MAN:

(FRENCH)

No, no, no, I don’t speak English.

Donny jams the barrel of his .45 into the thigh of the old man.

SGT. DONOWITZ

(ENGLISH)

BANG, BANG—in the leg, understand!

The old man nods his head, yes.

OLD MAN:

(FRENCH)

But I’m a veterinarian . . . animals . . .

I take care of animals . . .

Bridget screams from the table . . .

BRIDGET:

(ENGLISH)

He’s a fucking veterinarian, you imbecile!

SGT. DONOWITZ

He’s still a doctor. If he can get a bullet out of a cow, he can get a bullet outta you.

LT. ALDO

Right now, we just need morphine.

Donny yells at the old man:

SGT. DONOWITZ

Morphine! We need morphine!

The old man tries to explain in French that he’s not a human doctor

. . .

Donny takes the .45 and SHOOTS one of the DOGS in the cages.

Everybody jumps.

Donny SCREAMS at the old man:

SGT. DONOWITZ

MORPHINE!

BANG:

He SHOOTS another dog . . .

SGT. DONOWITZ

MORPHINE!

The old man begs him to stop and goes to get the morphine.

CUT TO:

The BODY of Gestapo Major DIETER HELLSTROM dead on the floor.

INT—LA LOUISIANE—NIGHT

We’re back in the basement tavern. Col. Hans Landa stands

over the corpse. He moves over to the next corpse, and a smile breaks out on his face.

He says in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA

Ahhh, Hugo, you’ve moved up in the world, I see. Lieutenant. And with

your record of insubordination. Truly remarkable.

A Nazi soldier named HERRMAN joins the S.S. officer.

COL. LANDA

And that one’s . . .

(pointing at

Wicki)

. . . name is Wilhelm Wicki. He’s an Austrian- born Jew who immigrated

to the United States when things

began turning sour for the Israelites. They are the two German-born members of the Basterds. They’ve been known

to don German uniforms to ambush squads.

FLASH ON:

three Nazi soldiers walking toward a company of other German soldiers. The three soldiers’ back are to us. Dried, bloody bullet holes cover the backs of the three uniforms.

The SERGEANT of the German company yells to the trio:

SGT. GERMAN COMPANY

What brings you all the way out here?

The TRIO NOW DOWN the GERMAN COMPANY with their machine guns.

BACK TO LANDA:

COL. LANDA

But that doesn’t look like this.

This is odd.

Looking down he sees something . . .

Bending down, he examines Fräulein von Hammersmark’s two pretty dress shoes lying on the floor.

One shoe is covered in blood.

The other, while blood-speckled, is fairly clean.

Picking up the clean shoe and holding it in his hand.

COL. LANDA

It would appear somebody’s missing. Somebody fashionable.

AN OFFSCREEN SOLDIER’S VOICE cries out:

SOLDIERS VOICE (OS)

Colonel, this one’s still alive!

We follow Hans to the spot on the floor where Sgt. Willi lies. He’s shot in the chest, but it looks like Max’s daddy is still alive.

INT—EXAMINING ROOM—NIGHT

Bridget on the examining table, post morphine shot.

The other Basterds in the room watch Aldo interrogate the German lady.

LT. ALDO

Now ’fore we yank that slug outta ya, you need to answer a few questions.

BRIDGET:

Few questions about what?

LT. ALDO

About I got three men dead back there, and why don’t you try tellin’ us what the fuck happened?

BRIDGET:

The British officer blew his German act, and a Gestapo major saw it.

LT. ALDO

’Fore we get into who shot John, Why did you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?

BRIDGET:

I can see, since you didn’t see what happened inside, the Nazis being there must look odd.

LT. ALDO

Yeah, we gotta word for that kinda odd in English. It’s called suspicious.

BRIDGET:

Don’t let your imagination get the better of you, Lieutenant. You met

the sergeant, Willi. He had a baby tonight. His commanding officer gave

him and his friends the night off to celebrate. The Germans being there

was just a tragic coincidence.

Aldo thinks for a moment . . .

LT. ALDO

Okay, I’ll buy that. He was either there with his men waiting for us, or he was there celebrating his son’s birthday. He wasn’t doin’ both.

LT. ALDO

How did the shootin’ start?

BRIDGET:

The English man gave himself away.

LT. ALDO

How did he do that?

BRIDGET:

He ordered three glasses.

She holds up three fingers, middle to pinky.

BRIDGET:

He ordered three glasses.

She holds up three fingers, thumb to middle.

BRIDGET:

This is the German three. The other

is odd. Germans would and did notice it.

LT. ALDO

Okay, let’s pretend there were no Germans, and everything went exactly

the way it was supposed to. What would of been the next step?

BRIDGET:

Tuxedoes. To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms, with all the military there, would have been suicide. But going as members of the German film industry,

they wear tuxedoes and blend in with everybody else. I arranged a tailor

to fit three tuxedoes tonight.

LT. ALDO

How did you intend to get them into the premiere?

BRIDGET:

Hand me my purse.

They do. And she opens it and takes out three tickets to the film premiere.

BRIDGET:

Lt. Hicox was going as my escort.

The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.

LT. ALDO

Can you still get us into that premiere?

BRIDGET:

Can you speak German better than your friends? No. Have I been shot? Yes.

I don’t see me tripping the light fantastic up the red carpet anytime

soon. Least of all by tomorrow night.

(pause)

However, there’s something you don’t know. There’s been two recent developments regarding Operation

Kino. One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.

LT. ALDO

Enormous changes at the last minute? That’s not very Germanic. Why the

hell is Goebbels doin’ stuff so damn peculiar?

BRIDGET:

It probably has something to do with the second development.

LT. ALDO

Which is?

FLASH ON:

IN A PRIVATE DINING ROOM IN GERMANY, the FUHRER, aka Adolf Hitler, aka Adolf Shicklegroover, aka the Bohemian Corporal, having dinner with Goebbels, only a few short days ago.

THE FUHRER:

(GERMAN)

I’ve been rethinking my position in regards to your Paris premiere of “Nation’s Pride.” As the weeks have

gone on and the Americans are on

the beach, I do find myself thinking more and more about this Private

Zoller. This boy has done something tremendous for us. And I’m beginning

to think my participation in this event could be meaningful.

BACK TO BRIDGET:

BRIDGET:

The Führer’s attending the premiere.

Donny breaks the team’s silence:

SGT. DONOWITZ

What?

LT. ALDO

When the hell did this happen?

BRIDGET:

The venue change, two weeks ago. The Führer’s attendance, four days ago.

LT. ALDO

And how come London don’t know nothing about that?

BRIDGET:

We need to get something straight,

once and for all. Everything London knows, it learned from me. If I

don’t know, London doesn’t know.

So now, this is me, informing you, Hitler’s coming to Paris.

SGT. DONOWITZ

FUCK A DUCK!

Aldo stands up from the chair, pacing as he takes in this new information.

BRIDGET:

What are you thinking?

LT. ALDO

I’m thinking getting a wack at plantin’ ole Uncle Adolph makes this a horse of a different color.

BRIDGET:

What’s that supposed to mean?

LT. ALDO

It means you’re gettin’ us into that premiere.

BRIDGET:

I’m going to probably end up losing this leg, bye bye, acting career, fun while it lasted. How do you expect me to walk up a red carpet?

LT. ALDO

The doggie

doc’s gonna dig that slug outta your

gam. Then he’s gonna

wrap

it up

in a

cast, and

you gotta good

“how I broke my leg

mountain climbing” story.

That’s German, ain’t

it?

Y’all

like

climbin’

mountains,

don’t

cha?

BRIDGET:

I don’t. I like smoking, drinking, and ordering in restaurants, but I see your point.

LT. ALDO

We fill ya up with morphine, till it’s comin out ya ears. Then just limp your little ass up that rouge car-pet.

BRIDGET:

Splendid. When the Nazis put me up against a wall, it won’t hurt

so much.

(changing tone) I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?

HIRSCHBERG:

Other than Yiddish?

BRIDGET:

Preferably.

Donny, referring to Aldo and himself:

SGT. DONOWITZ

We both speak a little Italian.

BRIDGET:

With an atrocious accent, no doubt. But that doesn’t exactly kill us in the crib. Germans don’t have a

good ear for Italian. So you mumble Italian and brazen through it, is

that the plan?

LT. ALDO

That’s about it.

BRIDGET:

That sounds good.

LT. ALDO

It sounds like shit, but what else we gonna do, go home?

BRIDGET:

No, it’s good. If you don’t blow it

with that, I can get you in the building. (changes tone)

So, who does what?

LT. ALDO

Well, I speak the most Italian, so I’ll be your escort. Donowitz speaks

the second most, so he’ll be your Italian cameraman. And Hirschberg

third most, so he’ll be Donny’s assistant.

HIRSCHBERG:

I don’t speak Italian.

LT. ALDO

Like I said, third best. Just keep

your fuckin’ mouth shut. In fact, why don’t you start practicing right now.

BRIDGET:

(meaning Utivich)

What about the little one?

UTIVICH:

Do you mean me?

BRIDGET:

I didn’t mean any offense.

UTIVICH:

None taken, you German cunt.

LT. ALDO

Utivich is the chauffeur.

UTIVICH:

I can’t drive.

Bridget SCREAMS in frustration:

BRIDGET:

You Americans are fucking useless!

UTIVICH:

Gimmie a break. I’m from Manhattan.

LT. ALDO

No worries, son. We got over fourteen hours before the movie tomorrow.

More than enough time for you to learn to drive.

UTIVICH:

No, no, no, no, Lieutenant, it’s not!

LT. ALDO

Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, Private, it is. And yes, yes, yes, you will.

(changes tone)

Look, Utivich, you and I both know, if we went to grade school together,

you damn sure ain’t copyin’ off of my test. Well, I lernt to drive in four hours on a Tennessee mountain road.

And I’m a shit-for-brains coal miner bootlegger. Hirschberg, you know how to drive, right?

HIRSCHBERG:

Yes.

LT. ALDO

Teach ’im.

BRIDGET:

But there is a problem. I’m a movie star. This is a movie premiere.

I can’t show up looking like I was just in a Nazi gunfight. Now I

have a dress for the premiere at my hotel. But sometime tomorrow I

have to get my hair done.

All the Basterds, except Donny, burst out laughing.

LT. ALDO

Sister, you must got wunderbar luck. Guess who went to beauty school?

The CAMERA WHIP-PANS to SGT. DONOWITZ.

Bridget rolls her eyes.

BLACK FRAME:

CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:

CHAPTER FIVE:

“REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE”

FADE OFF:

INT—SHOSANNA AND MARCEL’S LIVING QUARTERS—NIGHT

We’re in Shosanna and Marcel’s living quarters above the cinema. We’ve never been in here before.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS ONSCREEN:

“NIGHT OF ‘NATION’S PRIDE’ PREMIERE”

Shosanna’s standing before a full-length mirror in a real attractive forties-style dress for the premiere. She’s stunning. This is the first time in her life she’s had the opportunity

or the occasion to wear something like this. Since she knows this is the last night of her life, no time like the present.

SOUNDS of the hubbub of the premiere, not to mention the

German brass band that’s blaring Third Reich marches, can be heard coming from below.

Shosanna walks to her apartment window and looks down at the Germanic miasma below.

SHOSANNA’S POV

WE SEE all the pageantry below. Tons of SPECTATORS. Tons of guests dressed in Nazi uniforms, tuxedoes, and female finery, walking up the long red carpet (with a big swastika in the middle, naturally) leading into Shosanna’s cinema. The German brass band omm-pa-pa-ing away. German radio and film crews covering the event for the fatherland back home. And, of course, MANY GERMAN SOLDIERS providing security for this joyous Germanic occasion.

Shosanna COUGHS up a lugi and HOCKS it.

A GERMAN S.S. GENERAL being interviewed by a RADIO COMMENTATOR—the lugi HITS him right on his bald head.

Shosanna goes back to the full-length mirror, places a very fashionable forties-style hat on her head, then lowers the period- style black fishnet veil over her face. She takes out

a small GUN and puts it in the pocket of her dress, and it’s on. She exits the apartment door to join the premiere.

From this point on, there’s no turning back. It’s all the way baby, all the fucking way!

INT—CINEMA STAIRWELL—NIGHT

The stairwell in the building that connects the living

quarters with the cinema. Shosanna walks down the stairs and goes through a door that puts her next to the projection booth door. She takes out a key and opens it.

INT—PROJECTION BOOTH—NIGHT

Marcel’s prepping the film reels for tonight. The five silver metal film cans that carry one 35mm reel of film each are laid out. The cans for reels one and two are empty. Cans for reel three, our specially marked can for reel four, and the can for reel five (which should never see the light of a projector) lie in wait.

Shosanna, looking like a forties movie star, enters the projection booth.

The scene in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

MARCEL:

Ooh la la, Danielle Darrieux, this is so exciting. Pleased to meet you.

SHOSANNA:

Shut up, fool.

Marcel lifts up the veil covering her face and their lips meet.

SHOSANNA:

Cheeky black bugger. I have to go down and socialize with these Hun pigs. Let’s go over it again?

MARCEL:

Reel one is on the first projector. Reel two is on the second. Three and four are ready to go.

SHOSANNA:

Okay, the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel. Our film comes on in the fourth reel, so somewhere toward the end of the third reel,

go down and lock the doors of the auditorium. Then take your place

behind the screen, and wait for my

CUE when I give it to you: BURN IT DOWN!

INT—CINEMA LOBBY—NIGHT

The pageantry of the evening is in full swing, as all the German beautiful people enter the cinema. They mingle in the swastika-covered, Greek-nude-statue-peppered lobby. Nazi military commanders, high-ranking party officials, and German celebrities (Emil Jannings, Veit Harlan) hobnob and drink Champagne from passing WAITERS, who carry glasses on silver trays.

We see Shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby parlor entrance. She descends the staircase and busies herself with theater stuff.

At the top of the staircase, looking down at the master race in all their finery, is Col. Hans Landa, dressed in his finest S.S. dress uniform.

CAMERA FRAME:

directly behind him. On the right side, we see the figure of Col. Landa, from behind, watching the guests entering the cinema. On the left side of the frame is the cinema entrance, from

alooking-down perspective of the guests entering the building. THEN . . .

A THINK BUBBLE, like in a comic book, appears on the left

side of the frame, obscuring the cinema entrance. Inside Landa’s think bubble a little scene plays out.

THINK BUBBLE:

A hospital room filled with DOCTORS, NURSES, and a

PATIENT in a hospital bed. Then Col. Landa enters the room and screams at everybody:

COL. LANDA

I want everybody out of this room!

They start to leave.

COL. LANDA

That means now, goddamnit!

They RUSH OUT.

He walks over to the patient in the hospital bed. It’s none other than SGT. WILLI, and yes, he’s still alive.

Landa pulls up a chair next to the bed and sits down.

COL. LANDA

Can you speak, Sergeant?

SGT. WILLI

(weakly)

Yes, Colonel.

COL. LANDA

Tell me everything that happened in there.

The THINK BUBBLE DISSOLVES away, revealing the entrance again, and as if on perfect cue, in walks Bridget von Hammersmark, dressed lovely, leg in a big white cast. The three Basterds in their tuxedos flank her.

CU COL. LANDA smiles.

He descends the stairs, toward the four saboteurs . . .

They speak in GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA

Fräulein von Hammersmark, what

has befallen Germany’s most elegant swan?

BRIDGET:

Col. Landa, it’s been years.

Dashing as ever, I see.

COL. LANDA

Flattery will get you everywhere, Fräulein.

They chuckle and air kiss.

COL. LANDA

So what’s happened to your lovely leg? A by-product of kicking ass in the German cinema, no doubt.

BRIDGET:

Save your flattery, you old dog. I know too many of your former conquests to fall into that honeypot.

Chuckle . . . chuckle . . .

COL. LANDA

Seriously, what happened?

BRIDGET:

Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I might add, at mountain climbing. And this was the result.

COL. LANDA

Mountain climbing? That’s how you injured your leg—mountain climbing?

BRIDGET:

Believe it or not, yes, it is.

A brief moment passes between the two . . .

THEN . . .

The colonel BURSTS OUT with UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. So uproarious, in fact, that it’s quite disconcerting to the four saboteurs.

The colonel begins to regain his composure . . .

COL. LANDA

Forgive me, Fräulein. I don’t mean to laugh at your misfortune. It’s just

. . . mountain climbing? I’m curious, Fräulein, what could have ever

compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor?

The double meaning is not lost on the German actress.

BRIDGET:

Well, I shan’t be doing it again, I can tell you that.

COL. LANDA

That cast looks as fresh as my old

Uncle Gustave. When were you climbing this mountain, last night?

BRIDGET:

Very good eye, Colonel. It happened yesterday morning.

COL. LANDA

Hummm. And where exactly in Paris is this mountain?

This stops her for a second.

Then Landa laughs it off, taking them off the hook.

COL. LANDA

I’m just teasing you, Fräulein. You know me, I tease rough. So who are your three handsome escorts?

BRIDGET:

I’m afraid neither of the three speak a word of German. They’re friends of

mine from Italy. This is a wonderful Italian stuntman, Antonio Margheriti.

(meaning Aldo)

A very talented cameraman, Enzo Gorlomi. (meaning Donny)

And Enzo’s camera assistant, Dominick Decocco.

The German Fräulein turns to the three tuxedo-wearing Basterds.

BRIDGET:

(ITALIAN)

Gentlemen, this is an old friend, Colonel Hans Landa of the S.S.

The Basterds know only too well who Landa the Jew Hunter is, but they can’t show it.

Aldo sticks out his hand . . .

LT. ALDO

Buongiorno.

The German takes his hand . . .

COL. LANDA

Margheriti . . .

(ITALIAN)

Am I saying it correctly? . . . Margheriti?

LT. ALDO

(ITALIAN)

Yes. Correct.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)

Margheriti . . . Say it for me once, please . .

. ?

LT. ALDO

Margheriti.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)

I’m sorry, again . . . ?

LT. ALDO

Margheriti.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)

Once more . . .?

LT. ALDO

Margheriti.

COL. LANDA

Margheriti.

(FRENCH) It means daisies, I believe.

Turning his gaze to Donny.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)

What’s your name again?

SGT. DONOWITZ

Enzo Gorlomi.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)

Again . . . ?

SGT. DONOWITZ

Gorlomi.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)

One more time, but let me really hear the music in it.

SGT. DONOWITZ

(HAMMY ITALIAN)

Gorlomi.

Now to Hirschberg . . .

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)

And you?

Then Hirschberg breaks out the best Italian accent of the group:

HIRSCHBERG:

Dominick Decocco.

COL. LANDA

Dominick Decocco?

HIRSCHBERG:

Dominic Decocco.

COL. LANDA

Bravo . . . Bravo.

BRIDGET:

(GERMAN)

Well, my two cameraman friends need to find their seats.

Col. Landa stops a WAITER with a tray of champagne glasses.

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN)

Not so fast. Let’s enjoy some champagne.

Everyone gets a glass.

COL. LANDA

(FRENCH)

—Oh, Mademoiselle Mimieux, please join us. I have some friends I’d like you to meet.

Shosanna joins the circle and is handed a champagne glass.

This is the first moment the Basterds are aware of Shosanna.

COL. LANDA

(FRENCH)

May I say, Mademoiselle, you look divine.

SHOSANNA (FRENCH)

Merci.

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN)

This lovely young lady is Mademoiselle Emmanuelle Mimieux. This is her cinema, and she is our hostess for the evening.

(FRENCH)

And, Mademoiselle, this battered, broken, and none-worse-for-the-wear German goddess, is Bridget von Hammersmark.

BRIDGET:

Bonjour.

SHOSANNA:

Bonjour.

BRIDGET:

(FRENCH)

I’m afraid my companions don’t speak

any French. They’re Italian. This is Antonio, Enzo, and Dominick.

All three smile goofy, spaghetti-bender smiles.

COL. LANDA

(FRENCH)

Actually, Fräulein von Hammersmark’s Italian associates need help finding their seats. Perhaps Mademoiselle Mimieux would be so kind as to escort them?

SHOSANNA (FRENCH)

It would be my pleasure. Let me see your tickets?

Donny hands her two tickets. She indicates for them to follow her.

Donny and Hirschberg both exchange one last look with Aldo, then follow the young French girl into the auditorium.

INT—AUDITORIUM—NIGHT

The cinema auditorium is filling up quickly with gray and black uniforms.

Shosanna finds the two counterfeit Italians their seats.

After she points out their seats, she turns to leave . . .

Hirschberg . . .

reaches out and grabs her wrist. . . .

He looks her in the face and, filled with tremendous guilt, because if he’s successful tonight he’s going to blow this

cute French girl to smithereens, he says:

HIRSCHBERG:

Grazie.

The cute French girl looks back at the goofy-looking Italian boy with slicked-back hair that makes him look kind of

Jewish with tremendous guilt, knowing if she is successful tonight, she’s going to burn him alive, and says:

SHOSANNA:

Prego.

BACK TO THE LOBBY

They begin flicking the lights on and off. A GERMAN SOLDIER YELLS IN GERMAN:

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Take your seats! The show is about to begin!

Everybody take your seats!

Col. Landa, Lt. Aldo, and Bridget are still together.

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN)

I must call the Führer. He doesn’t

want to make his entrance until everybody is seated. Come with me, Frau von Hammersmark. The Führer has

heard you’re here, and he wishes to commend you personally.

BRIDGET:

(GERMAN)

Me? Why?

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN)

Don’t be modest. Everybody is quite taken with your resolve. An accident like you’ve just experienced, and

yet you still show up to an important party event. The Führer

was quite adamant in his gratitude. We’ll use Mademoiselle Mimieux’s office.

(to Aldo

in Italian)

I’m afraid I must rob you of your companion, but only for a moment.

BRIDGET:

(ITALIAN)

Yes, apparently the Führer wishes to commend me.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)

Wait here a moment. I promise I won’t detain her long.

What are either of them supposed to do, argue?

Col. Landa goes over to one of the Nazi GUARDS/USHERS and whispers in his ear, guesturing toward Aldo. Like he’s saying, leave the boy alone, till we come back . . . Or is he?

Col. Landa limps Bridget away toward Shosanna’s office.

As Aldo stands in the lobby, more and more people enter the auditorium, till it’s only Aldo and the six Nazi guards/ushers in the now-vacant lobby.

INT—SHOSANNA’S OFFICE—NIGHT

Shosanna’s cinema manager’s office. It’s small, cluttered, and dominated by a desk.

They both enter.

Col. Landa closes the door behind him and LOCKS IT.

Bridget notices but says nothing.

Now the two Germans are alone.

COL. LANDA

Have a seat, Fräulein.

Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk.

She lowers herself in the chair.

Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk,

opposite her, the S.S. Colonel pulls another little chair over and places it in front of the fräulein.

He sits, their knees almost touching.

The colonel points to the foot not in the cast.

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN)

Let me see your foot.

BRIDGET:

(GERMAN)

I beg your pardon?

Patting his lap.

COL. LANDA

Put your foot in my lap.

BRIDGET:

Colonel, you embarrass me.

COL. LANDA

I assure you, Fräulein, my intention is not to flirt.

Patting his lap more with more aggression.

The nervous fräulein lifts up her strappy dress shoe enclosed foot and places it in the colonel’s lap.

The Colonel very delicately unfastens the thin straps that hold the fräulein’s shoe on her foot . . .

. . . . He removes the shoe . . .

. . . . Leaving only the fräulein’s bare foot . . .

THEN . . .

He removes from his heavy S.S. coat pocket the pretty dress shoe the fräulein left behind at La Louisiane . . .

He slips it on her foot . . .

. . . . It fits like a glove.

Bridget knows she’s BUSTED.

Col. Landa smiles and says in ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA

What’s that American expression . . .

“If the shoe fits . . . you must wear it.”

He removes her foot from his lap.

BRIDGET:

(GERMAN)

What now, Colonel?

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN) Do you admit your treachery?

She stares defiant daggers into him.

BRIDGET:

(GERMAN)

The only think I will admit to is resisting you

. . .

(ENGLISH)

Sons-a-bitches . . .

(GERMAN)

. . . to my last breath.

COL. LANDA “Resist to your last breath”?

SUDDENLY . . .

Hans LUNGES forward, putting his strong mitts around Bridget von Hammersmark’s lily-white, delicate neck, and with all the violence of a lion in mid-pounce, SQUEEZES with all his MIGHT.

Bridget’s face turns tomato RED, as the VEINS in her face BULGE and her esophagus is CRUSHED in his GRIP.

With a violent YANK, he JERKS her TO THE FLOOR. She TUMBLES

out of the chair, Landa never releasing his GRIP around her throat. Now fully on top of her, he BEARS DOWN, SQUEEZING THE VERY LIFE OUT OF HER. Everything he has, he brings to bear on

the elegant lady’s neck.

Then, to finally finish her off, he begins BANGING THE BACK OF HER HEAD, HARD AGAINST THE FLOOR . . .

BANG!

BANG!

BANG!

She’s dead.

He releases the grip around her throat. His hands are TREMBLING . . .

He rises.

Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bare hands is the most violent act a human being can commit.

Also, only humans strangle, opposable thumbs being a quite important part of the endeavor. As Hans Landa stands, the sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task

still surges through him. He tries to gain control of the trembling that is rippling through his body. He takes out a silver S.S. FLASK (filled with peach schnapps) and knocks back

a couple of swigs. He holds his hand out in front of him. The TREMBLING is beginning to subside. He picks up the telephone.

Into the phone, in German, he says:

COL. LANDA

Inform the Führer the audience has taken their seats, and we’re ready to begin.

Step one in Hans’s master plan, done.

He then dials another number . . .

INT—LOBBY—NIGHT

Aldo in the lobby . . .

WHEN . . .

. . . . He’s JUMPED by the SIX NAZI USHERS . . .

He’s THROWN

ROUGHLY:

to the

ground face

first.

Like the modern-

day

Secret Service,

within

seconds his

wrists

are handcuffed behind

his

back and he’s

searched. They

find the BOMB attached to his

ankle. It’s

removed, and

a

BLACK:

CLOTH:

BAG:

is

pulled over his head.

Then he’s hoisted

up and

RUSHED out of

the

building.

This happens in mere seconds, and quietly too. No one in the auditorium is none the wiser . . .

INT—AUDITORIUM—NIGHT

. . . including Donowitz and Hirschberg, sitting among the master race, waiting for showtime.

EXT—CINEMA—NIGHT

The six Nazi soldiers hustle the hooded Aldo down the red carpet, then into the alley beside the cinema.

Aldo’s put up against a wall.

Inside the black hood, he’s SCREAMING every insulting thing about Germany, Germans, German food, German

shepherd . . . anything.

COL. LANDA’S VOICE (OS)

Shut up!

The faceless black hood does.

Col. Landa, now standing directly in front of his hooded prisoner, says in ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA

As Stanley said to Livingstone: Lieutenant Aldo

Raine, I presume?

LT. ALDO

Hans Landa?

COL. LANDA

You’ve had a nice long run, Aldo.

Alas, you’re now in the hands of the S.S. My hands to be exact. And they’ve been waiting a long time to touch you.

He reaches out with his finger and lightly touches Aldo’s face right in the middle of the hood.

Aldo’s head VIOLENTLY FLINCHES.

COL. LANDA

Caught ya flinching.

In German, he orders the men to put Aldo in the back of a truck.

Aldo, bound and bagged, is put in the truck. Also in the truck is Utivich, wearing a makeshift chauffeur’s uniform, bound and bagged like the lieutenant.

The truck drives off.

Col. Landa turns around and SEES FROM A DISTANCE Hitler’s motorcade pull up to the cinema. Then the Führer, Goebbels, Francesca, and the rest of the entourage make their way down

the red carpet into the cinema.

Landa smiles.

EXT TRUCK (MOVING)—NIGHT

We see the truck leaving the city of Paris, under the veil of night.

We also seem to be leaving the drama of Operation Kino.

INT—TRUCK (MOVING)—NIGHT

The two hooded prisoners bounce along in the back of the truck.

Utivich is crying inside his hood.

LT. ALDO

Utivich?

UTIVICH:

Is that you, Lieutenant?

LT. ALDO

Yep.

UTIVICH:

Do you know what happened to Donny? Hirschberg?

The woman?

UTIVICH:

Do you know what happened to Donny? Hirschberg? The woman?

LT. ALDO

No, I do not.

UTIVICH:

Lieutenant, sorry I’m crying.

LT. ALDO

Nothin’ to be sorry about, son.

This bag get to anyone.

UTIVICH:

Not exactly John Wayne, am I?

LT. ALDO

John Wayne’s a pampered movie star. He bursts into tears if his cook busts his yoke at breakfast. Just try puttin’ a bag over his head and hear what kinda sounds he makes.

Utivich giggles through the tears.

LT. ALDO

I just want you to know, son, I was real proud of you tonight. Learnin’ how to drive overnight. Driving in that limo line. You was in the hot seat, son, and you stood up real good.

Utivich cries LOUDER.

Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivich’s foot, and places his foot on top.

The TOUCH has a slightly calming effect on Utivich.

In the darkness, Utivich has reclaimed his dignity.

EXT—COUNTRY TAVERN—NIGHT

The truck pulls up to a small tavern outside of Paris (not La Louisaiane).

The two hooded prisoners are walked inside the establishment.

INT—COUNTRY TAVERN—NIGHT

The hooded men are led into the closed for business, but open for something else rustic tavern.

The Nazi guards unlock the handcuffs, then sit them down in chairs.

Then, simultaneously, the hoods are YANKED OFF.

The two prisoners are seated at a table, in what they can now see is a rustic tavern. On the table is one telephone, one bottle of Chianti, and three glasses. And on the opposite end of the table sits Col. Hans Landa.

ANAZI SOLDIER sits posted at an impressive-looking two-way radio set up in the tavern.

Col. Landa starts in right away at the two baffled, discombobulated American soldiers.

They will only speak ENGLISH in the scene.

COL. LANDA

Italian? Really?

(BEAT)

What could you have possibly been thinking?

LT. ALDO

Well, I speak a little Italian—

COL. LANDA

I speak a little Tagalog, but I wouldn’t begin to presume I could pass for Filipino. Don’t get me

wrong, I understand you were in a pickle, what with you losing your Germans. And I have nothing but admiration for improvisation. Still . . . Chico Marx is more

convincing. If the three of you had shown up at the premiere dressed

in woman’s attire, it would have been more convincing.

Landa’s eyes go to the two Nazi guards behind the prisoners.

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN)

You may leave us. But stay alert outside.

They exit, leaving the colonel, the lieutenant, the private, and a German radio man in the corner.

COL. LANDA

So you’re Aldo the Apache?

LT. ALDO

So you’re the Jew Hunter?

COL. LANDA

Jew Hunter (pfuit). I’m a detective. A damn good detective. Finding people is my specialty. So naturally

I worked for the Nazis finding people. And yes, some of them were Jews.

But Jew Hunter? Just the name that stuck.

UTIVICH:

Well, you do hafta admit, it is catchy.

COL. LANDA

Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you? Aldo the

Apache and the Little Man?

UTIVICH:

What do you mean, the Little Man?

COL. LANDA

The German’s nickname for you.

UTIVICH:

The German’s nickname for me is the Little Man?

COL. LANDA

Or the “Little One”, either one means you. And as if to make my point, I’m a

little surprised how tall you

are in real life. I mean, you’re a little fellow. But not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.

LT. ALDO

Where are my men? Where is Bridget von Hammersmark?

COL. LANDA

Bridget von Hammersmark. Oh, I’m sure she’s in whatever, big bubbling

cesspool in hell the devil reserves for traitors of her ilk.

COL. LANDA

(CON’T)

Well, let’s just say she got what she deserved. And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.

Now as far as your paisanos

Sergeant Donowitz and Private Hirschberg—

LT. ALDO

How do you know our names?

COL. LANDA

Lt. Aldo, if you don’t think I wouldn’t interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors . . . ?

We simply aren’t operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed. Now, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs. At this moment, both Hirschberg

and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in. Seats

0023 and 0024, if my memory serves. Explosives, still around their ankles, still ready to explode.

And your mission, some

would call it a terrorist plot, as of this moment is still a go.

The two basterds don’t believe this. It can’t be true.

LT. ALDO

That’s a pretty exciting story.

What’s next, Eliza on the ice?

COL. LANDA

However, all I have to do is pick up that phone right there, inform the cinema, and your plans kaput.

LT. ALDO

IF they’re still there, and IF they’re still alive, and that’s one big IF, there ain’t no way you gonna take

them boys without settin’ off them bombs.

COL. LANDA

I have no doubt, and yes, some Germans will die, and yes, it will ruin the evening, and yes, Goebbels will be very very very mad at you

for what you’ve done to his big night. But you won’t get Hitler, you won’t

get Goebbels, you won’t get Goering, and you won’t get Boormann. And you need all four to end the war.

(pause)

But if I don’t pick up that phone right there, you may very well get all four. And if you get all four, you end the war . . . tonight.

The Nazi colonel lifts up the bottle of Chianti and fills three glasses. As he pours, he says:

COL. LANDA

So, gentlemen, let’s discuss the prospect of ending the war . . . tonight.

All three have their Chianti filled glasses.

COL. LANDA

So the way I see it, since Hitler’s death, or possible rescue, rests

solely on my reaction . . . If I do nothing . .

. It’s as if I’m causing his death, even more than yourselves.

Would you agree?

LT. ALDO

I guess so.

COL. LANDA

How about you, Utivich?

UTIVICH:

I guess so too.

COL. LANDA

Good, we more or less all agree. Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler, and killing Goebbels, and killing Goering, and killing Boormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies,

only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.

Now they get it.

COL. LANDA

If you want to win the war, tonight, we have to make a deal.

LT. ALDO

What kinda deal?

COL. LANDA

The kind you wouldn’t have the

authority to make. However, I’m sure this mission of yours has a

commanding officer? A general, I’m betting. For

. . .

(thinking)

. . . . O.S.S. would be my guess.

Aldo’s eyebrows reveal that was a good guess.

COL. LANDA

Oooh, that’s a bingo. Is that the way you say it, that’s a bingo?

LT. ALDO

You just say, bingo.

COL. LANDA

Bingo! How fun. But I digress, where

were we? Oh, yes, make a deal. Over there is a very capable two-way

radio. And sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Herrman. Get me somebody on

the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my—

let’s call it, the terms of my conditional surrender, if that tastes better going down.

BACK TO THE PREMIER

Shosanna is in the booth. She brings down the lights.

In the packed, excited auditorium, the house lights go down.

BACK TO LANDA AND THE BASTERDS

Landa, with radio headphones over his ears and a microphone

in his hand, talks to the UNSEEN/UNHEARD American brass on the other end.

COL. LANDA

. . . So, when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of

Operation Kino from the very beginning, as a double agent.

Anything I’ve done in my guise as an S.S. colonel was sanctioned by the O.S.S., as a necessary evil to

establish my cover with the Germans. And it was my placement of

Lieutenant Raine’s dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels’s opera box that assured their demise. By the way, that last

part is actually true.

FLASH ON:

Landa placing bomb in Hitler and Goebbels’s opera box.

BACK TO LANDA:

COL. LANDA

I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.

I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.

He looks over and sees Aldo and Utivich watching the one-sided conversation.

COL. LANDA

In fact, I want all the members of “Operation Kino” to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor. Full citizenship for myself—but that goes without saying. And I would

like the United States of America to purchase property for me on

Nantucket island, as a reward for all the countless lives I’ve saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter than imagined end. Do you have all that, sir?

(pause)

I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.

(pause)

He’s right here.

The colonel hands the headphones and microphone to Aldo.

LT. ALDO

Yes, sir?

We HEAR the VOICE on the other end of the radio give Aldo his orders:

RADIO VOICE (OS)

Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as

prisoners. Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck,

drive to our lines. Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you. You will

then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for

debriefing. Is that clear, Lieutenant?

LT. ALDO

Yes, sir.

The conversation is over. He puts the radio down.

The three men look at one another.

Landa picks up his wine.

COL. LANDA

So I suppose the only thing left to do is lift a glass and toast to Donowitz and Hirschberg’s success. You too, Herrman, come over here.

The four men, Col. Hans Landa, Lt. Aldo Raine, Pfc. Smithson Utivich, and Herrman, lift up four glasses of wine.

COL. LANDA

Gentlemen, to history, and its witnesses.

CHEERS.

BACK TO THE PREMIERE

WE CUT TO THE B/W FILM ON SCREEN.

Fredrick Zoller, playing himself, is in an ornamental tower in a Russian village, picking off RUSSIAN SOLDIERS below.

A RUSSIAN GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY

peering at the German private through binoculars. He lowers the long-range glasses and confers with one of his OFFICERS.

GEN. KCHOVLANSKEY

(RUSSIAN)

What’s the death toll?

OFFICER:

(RUSSIAN)

47, so far.

WE HEAR A SHOT.

OFFICER:

(RUSSIAN)

48.General, I implore you, we must destroy that tower!

GEN. KCHOVLANSKEY

(RUSSIAN)

That tower is one of the oldest and most beautiful structures in Russia.

I won’t be responsible for turning a thousand years of history into dust!

A BRAVE RUSSIAN SOLDIER tries to run between two buildings.

Zoller gets him.

Then proceeds to pick him apart, one bullet at a time.

SHOSANNA IN THE PROJECTION BOOTH

She removes “REEL 4” (the Special Shosanna Reel) and prepares

it on the second projector. Reel 3, on the first projector, playing now, is halfway through. In a few short minutes, it’s going to be show time.

Marcel says to Shosanna in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

MARCEL:

It’s time. I should go lock the auditorium and take my place behind the screen.

This is the last time they will ever see each other—too much to say. He holds her in his arms and lays a one kiss before I die wet one on her.

DONOWITZ AND HIRSCHBERG

sit in their seats watching the movie, surrounded by DRESS-UNIFORM NAZIS. They’ve developed a dopey way of communicating with each other in this hostile environment.

Basically, speaking English as if it were gibberish Italian they say English words, only adding an “I” or “A” or “O” to the end of it. And saying it in an exaggerated Italian accent, complete with pantomimes.

Donowitz leans into Hirschberg and says in a whisper:

They speak in ITALIAN-ISH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

SGT. DONOWITZ

(ITALIAN-ISH)

I-a go-a toilet-a, set-ta Boom-a.

(I go to the toilet and set the bomb.) When-a I-a go-a, you-a set-ta Boom-a. (When I go, you set your bomb.)

Hirschberg indicates/pantomimes that he can’t set his bomb surrounded by all these Nazis.

Donowitz pantomimes crossing his legs and setting the bomb on his ankle in his seat. Then getting up and dropping it in the back of the auditorium in the dark.

Hirschberg doesn’t get it.

HIRSCHBER:

What-a?

(What?)

Donny pantomimes again, more exaggerated, and with less patience.

HIRSCHBERG:

Affirm-ato, affirm-ato (Affirmative, affirmative.)

SGT. DONOWITZ

They-o look-o screen-a, not-o you-a. (They’re looking at the screen, not you.)

HIRSCHBERG:

Fantastic-o. (Fantastic.)

SGT. DONOWITZ

After-teri, set-ta, five-o moment-o (pointing to

watch)

You-a, pphisst.

(After you set the bomb, wait five minutes, and get out of here.)

HIRSCHBERG:

What-o? (What?)

SGT. DONOWITZ

Confussi-i, confuss-i, confuss-i. (Confused, confused, confused.) What-a, and-o what-o, same-o?

(I thought “What-a” meant “What.” Does “What-o” mean “What,” as well?)

HIRSCHBERG:

Oh-o, sorr-o, I-o meant-a “What-a.” (Oh, sorry, I meant what.)

SGT. DONOWITZ After-teri, you-a set-ta bom-a, five-o moment-o, you-a, fuck-o pphisst.

(After you set the bomb, wait five minutes and get the fuck out of here.)

HIRSCHBERG:

Affirm-ato, affirm-ato. (Affirmative, affirmative.)

SGT. DONOWITZ

Good-a, luck-a. (Good luck.)

Donowitz stands up from his seat and walks out of the dark auditorium into the lobby. The Nazi guards/ushers are gone, and the lobby is completely empty. Seeing the STAIRS leading down to the WATER CLOSET/BATHROOM, he descends them to plant the Boom-a—I mean, the bomb.

DESCENDING THE STAIRS

leading to the water closet. Like a lot of old cinemas, not only was the water closet located under the auditorium, you had to pass through a rather large SMOKING LOUNGE to get to it. In the smoking lounge are TEN NAZI ENLISTED MEN, the guards/ushers for the event, smoking and indulging in soldiers’ gossip. They’re all in dress uniforms, and all are armed.

Donowitz, in his tuxedo, acts cool and walks right through them.

They look up but don’t disturb their time-off vibe.

Donny enters the big water closet. Except for ONE LONE NAZI ENLISTED MAN at the urinal, it would appear as if

Donny has the whole washroom to himself.

He enters the privacy of a toilet stall and locks the door.

MARCEL IN LOBBY:

He descends the stairs leading down from the projection booth into the empty lobby. He goes to one of the auditorium doors

and peers inside.

WE SEE THE SCREEN AND THE AUDIENCE FROM MARCEL’S POV in the back of the room. The audience seems riveted to Fredrick’s exploits onscreen.

Marcel closes the door and, with a KEY, DEADBOLTS it SHUT.

INSIDE THE AUDITORIUM

WE PAN OFF THE SCREEN to Marcel, who locks the two doors on either side of the screen . . . Due to curtains placed there, no one notices Marcel’s actions.

Marcel then goes BEHIND THE SCREEN. WE SEE THE IMAGE

(backward) of Fredrick’s sniper battle HUGE, COVERING THE ENTIRE SIDE OF THE ROOM . . . A PILE of over 300 nitrate FILM PRINTS lies like a junk pile, right behind the screen.

Sitting down in a wooden chair facing the screen and pile-o-film, he lights up a cigarette, an absolute no-no in a cinema of this era, but tonight, what does it matter?

He smokes and waits for his cue to . . . BURN IT DOWN!

FREDRICK IN OPERA BOX

alongside Hitler, Goebbels, Francesca, and Boormann. Onscreen

the battle rages. He leans over and whispers something in Goebbel’s ear we can’t hear. Goebbels makes a very sympathetic face (at least sympathetic for Goebbels) and says in German:

GOEBBELS:

Perfectly understandable, dear boy. You go now, and we’ll see you after the show.

He exits the opera box and walks to the projection booth door. He raps on the door in a trying to be amusing way.

The door opens, just a little bit. Shosanna, not friendly, stares at him.

He, as usual, is all smiles and charm.

They speak in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

FREDRICK:

Are you the manager of this cinema? I want my money back. That actor in the movie stinks.

He laughs.

She doesn’t even smile. She says, all serious business:

SHOSANNA:

What are you doing here?

FREDRICK:

I came to visit you.

SHOSANNA:

Can’t you see how busy I am?

FREDRICK:

Then allow me to lend an assist.

SHOSANNA:

Fredrick, it’s not funny. You can’t be here. This is your premiere. You need to be out there with them.

As Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale with all the charm at his command, Shosanna listens, knowing the third reel is just about over and her big reel change is coming up.

FREDRICK:

Normally, you would be right.

And for all the other films I do, I intend to endure evenings like tonight in the proper spirit. However, the fact remains, this film is based on my military exploits. And in this case, my exploits

consisted of me killing many men. Consequently, the part of the film

that’s playing now, . . . I don’t like watching this part.

SHOSANNA:

Fredrick, I am sorry, but—

FREDRICK:

—So, I thought I’d come up here and do what I do best, annoy you. And from the look on your face, it would appear I haven’t lost my touch.

DONNY IN TOILET:

Sgt. Donowitz, with BOMB in his lap, sets the timer for six minutes from now. He then places the bomb in the back of the toilet tank.

CAMERA ON FLOOR OF WATER CLOSET

We see the tile of the floor stretch out before us. We see

Donny’s feet in the closed toilet stall. We HEAR the OFFSCREEN Nazi enlisted man finish his piss. Then HIS SHOES WALK

THROUGH FRAME . . . WE FOLLOW THEM TO . . . the SINK . . . WE STAY ON the shoes . . . as WE HEAR the Soldier WASH HIS HANDS . . . THEN

. . . THE CAMERA RISES UP HIS PANT LEG . . . till . . . WE’RE EYE LEVEL with the German soldier, with an ARMY CAP on his head, who’s done washing his hands . . . THEN . . . the soldier removes

his cap, brushes some bangs out of his face, and WE SEE

THE SWASTIKA HAND-CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD, THE UNDENIABLE MARK OF THE BASTERDS. He SPLASHES some WATER ON HIS FACE, puts his

cap back on his head, and joins his comrades in the smoking lounge. As he exits THE FRAME, he says to somebody OFFSCREEN;

SWASTIKA FOREHEAD

(GERMAN)

Hey, Fritz, you owe me three cigarettes. Now pay up.

SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK

Fredrick still outside the doorway, and Shosanna still baring the way.

SHOSANNA:

I have to get prepared for the reel change.

FREDRICK:

Let me do it?

SHOSANNA:

No.

FREDRICK:

Oh, please, it’s been two years since I’ve done a reel change.

SHOSANNA:

I said, no.

FREDRICK:

(cute whine)

Come on, it’s my premiere.

SHOSANNA:

Are you so used to the Nazis kissing your ass, you’ve forgotten what the

word “no” means? No, Fredrick, you can’t come in here. Now go away!

No subtitles for Fredrick needed this time. He gets it.

He does a one-armed PILE-DRIVE PUSH on the door, knocking both it OPEN and Shosanna back into the room.

Fredrick, a different cat than we’ve seen up till now, enters the booth, closing the door behind him and LOCKING it.

The quite startled Shosanna says to Fredrick:

SHOSANNA:

Fredrick, you hurt me.

FREDRICK:

Well, it’s nice to know you can feel something. Even if it’s just physical pain.

Fredrick steps forward . . .

Shosanna steps backward . . .

FREDRICK:

I’m not a man you say “Go away” to. There’s over three hundred dead bodies in Russia that, if they could, would testify to that.

After what I’ve done for you, you disrespect me at your peril.

BACK TO WASHROOM

The Swastika forehead soldier gets a light for his cigarette. He takes a big drag.

SOLDIER’S POV

He faces the washroom, and down that long row, he sees Donny emerge from the toilet stall. His tuxedo jacket is off and

draped over his right hand. Sporting the white dress shirt and black tuxedo vest, he’s quite far away, so now he just

looks like some guy in a tux who just finished taking a shit. Donny walks toward us . . .

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD

seeing him get closer . . .

SOLDIER POV:

Donny gets closer . . .

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD

seeing him closer still . . .

SOLDIER POV:

Donny gets closer . . .

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD begins to notice . . .

SOLDIER POV:

Donny getting closer, begins to notice the German soldier notice him . . .

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD

Now Donny is close enough for the soldier to recognize. His face SCREAMS:

SWASTIKA FOREHEAD

The Bear Jew!!!

The soldier’s GUN is out of its holster and rising toward Donny’s chest . . .

WHEN . . .

Donny raises his right arm, with the tuxedo jacket on it, and FIRES a GUN concealed under it.

HITTING Swastika Forehead in the chest . . . who finishes raising his GUN, FIRING, HITTING Donny in the chest . . .

The two soldiers FIRE INTO each other . . . till their weapons are empty, and the two men lie dead on the floor.

The ten other NAZIS in the room stand shocked at what just happened in front of them.

SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK IN THE PROJECTION ROOM

Fredrick hears the gunshots below them and turns toward the door.

FREDRICK:

What the hell was that?

While Fredrick’s back is turned, Shosanna takes a GUN out of her pocket and SHOOTS Fredrick THREE TIMES in the back . . .

. . . He CRASHES HARD into the door, then FALLS FACE FIRST to the floor . . .

Shosanna, gun in hand, looks out the projection booth window into the audience . . .

The ONSCREEN BATTLE rages so LOUDLY with GUNFIRE that her weapon didn’t stand a chance of being heard.

Her eyes go from the audience . . .

. . . up to the big screen . . .

. . . which holds FREDRICK ZOLLER in a tight, handsome CLOSEUP.

The face on the silver screen breaks the young girl’s heart . . .

. . . She looks to his body, lying face down on the floor, blood flowing from the holes she put in his back . . .

. . . His body moves a little, and he lets out a painful MOAN . . .

. . . DYING though he is, at this moment Fredrick is still ALIVE . . .

Shosanna moves to him . . .

. . . She touches him, and he lets out another MOAN . . .

. . . She turns his body over on its back . . .

. . . He’s holding a LUGER in his hand . . .

. . . He FIRES TWICE . . .

BANG BANG:

Two bullets HIT HER POINT BLANK IN THE CHEST . . .

THROWING HER against the wall, then FALLING FORWARD on her knees to the floor . . .

. . . Fredrick, Luger still in hand, takes aim from the floor . . .

. . . FIRES . . .

HITTING the bloody girl on the floor, in the thigh . . .

. . . SPINNING her BODY around in agony . . .

Like he did to the Russian onscreen, he picks her apart, one bullet at a time . . .

. . . FIRES . . .

A BULLET BLOWS OFF THE HEEL OF HER FOOT . . .

The Luger drops to floor. Fredrick DIES.

Our young French Jewish heroine lies on the projection booth floor in a pool of her own blood, her body RIDDLED with bullets, her nerve endings wracked with pain, CRIPPLED and DYING . . .

WHEN . . .

. . . The little bell on the 1st projector starts to ring, informing the projectionist it’s time for the REEL CHANGE.

Dying or not, if Shosanna intends to get her revenge, she’s going to have to lift her ass off the floor and execute this fucking reel change.

CINEMA AUDITORIUM

The battle onscreen continues. The audience is riveted.

The FUHRER

watches, completely caught up in the dramatic spectacle. He says to Goebbels in German:

HITLER:

Extraordinary, Joseph, simply extraordinary. This is your finest

film yet.

Goebbels is beyond proud. He smiles to Francesca, who proudly pats his hand.

PROJECTION BOOTH

Shosanna, bloody, crippled, and fucked, with great and painful effort, PULLS HERSELF OFF THE FLOOR . . .

AUDITORIUM:

Hirschberg, sitting in his seat, SETS the BOMB on his ankle, then stands up and begins scooting past everybody in his row’s knees.

PROJECTION BOOTH

Like the German heroine in one of Riefenstahl’s mountain films, Shosanna CLIMBS UP the 35mm film projector, like it was

Pitz Palu . . .

FILM ONSCREEN:

Private Zoller FIRING away from his perch. In the top far-

right corner of the FRAME, WE SEE the 1st REEL CHANGE MARK . . .

PROJECTION BOOTH

Shosanna hanging onto the projector, waiting for the 2nd reel change mark. It’s an agonizing effort . . .

BEHIND THE SCREEN

Marcel, smoking, waiting for his cue . . .

HIRSCHBERG:

gets out of his row and begins walking up the aisle in the middle of the cinema toward the exit.

ONSCREEN:

SERGIO LEONE CU FREDRICK. He SCREAMS to the Russians below:

MOVIE ZOLLER:

Who wants to send a message to

Germany?

In the top right of THE FRAME, the 2nd REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON . .

.

PROJECTION BOOTH

Shosanna TOSSES herself to the floor, as she THROWS THE CHANGE-OVER SWITCH on the 2nd projector . . .

EX CU PROJECTOR BULB

BLASTING WHITE in our face.

SLOW MOTION:

SHOSANNA FALLING . . .

EX CU 35MM FILM

MOVING . . .

SHOSANNA:

HITS the DUSTY ground HARD, NOT in slow motion . . .

PROJECTOR BEAM:

SHOOTS OUT OF THE LITTLE PROJECTION BOOTH WINDOW hits screen.

CU SHOSANNA:

on the floor, eyes closed, last breath blown into the dusty projection booth floor. Like her family before here, dead from Nazi bullets.

AUDITORIUM:

ON THE SILVER SCREEN FREDRICK’S EX CU

CUT TO:

ON SILVER SCREEN MATCHING SHOSANNA EX CU

CAMERA in the exact same placement, same background (B/W sky), SLIGHT LOW ANGLE LOOKING UP, so onscreen Shosanna is looking down on the Nazis, the way Fredrick was looking down on the Russians. The way this HUGE IMAGE OF SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE stares down the auditorium of Nazis brings to mind Orwells “1984”

Big Brother.

HITLER and GOEBBELS

React.

HIRSCHBERG:

standing in the middle of the aisle, turns toward the screen. When he sees Shosanna’s GIANT FACE, he’s gobsmacked.

BEHIND SCREEN:

Marcel sitting in the chair, with his cigarette, before the

EVEN MORE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA

SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE ONSCREEN

She stares down the packed house of Nazis and says in FRENCH:

SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE

I have a message for Germany. I’m interrupting your Nazi propaganda horseshit to inform you dispicable German swine that you’re all going to die.

HITLER and GOEBBELS react.

HIRSCHBERG reacts.

MARCEL smiles.

SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE

And I want you to look deep in the face of the

Jew who’s going to do it.

AUDITORIUM AUDIENCE

While the shocked German audience is transfixed to the screen, behind the heads of most of them . . .

The BOMB Landa set in Hitler and Goebbels’s opera box . . .

EXPLODES.

BLOWING TO SMITHEREENS HITLER, FRANCESA, and BOORMANN, and propelling GOEBBELS, still in his theater seat, across the auditorium, into the opposite wall and taking out a portion of the ceiling as well.

The crowd reacts . . .

The explosion causes the huge chandelier from Versailles to topple from its jury-rigged placement and CRASH onto the

audience below . . .

ONSCREEN THE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA finishes her WAR CRY.

SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE

My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face of Jewish vengeance! Marcel, BURN IT DOWN!

BEHIND THE SCREEN

Marcel takes his cigarette and FLICKS IT into the pile of nitrate film.

ONSCREEN SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE LAUGHS MANIACALLY at the scrambling little Nazis, running in a panic, as FLAMES LIKE

OUT OF A GIANT BLAST FURNACE BURST THROUGH SHOSANNA’S FACE and CLIMB UP THE WALLS of the cinema.

The AUDIENCE

STAMPEDES toward the exits . . .

HIRSCHBERG:

with bomb set on ankle, is caught in a massive “Day of the Locust”

SWARM OF BODIES . . .

People frantically pound on locked doors, trapping them to their grizzly fate.

The FLAMES and FIRE spread through the auditorium . . .

Hirschberg, caught in the people crunch, knows this is it.

HIS ANKLE BOMB GOES OFF

right underneath everybody in the room.

The effect this has on the people in the room is very similar

to that of the effect an M-80 blowing up in an ant hill would have on the ants. The auditorium is a literal red rain of legs, arms, heads, torsos, and asses.

THEN . . . ,

DONOWITZ’S TOILET BOMB

BLOWS UP UNDERNEATH the auditorium.

COLLAPSING THE CINEMA AND BLOWING OUT THE FRONT OF THE THEATER.

As MADAME MIMEUX’S CINEMA BURNS . . .

These SUBTITLES APPEAR ONSCREEN as if on a military teletype:

“OPERATION KINO A COMPLETE SUCCESS.”

FADE OUT:

FADE UP:

“HITLER DEAD. GOEBBELS DEAD. BOORMANN DEAD. GOERING DEAD. ZOLLER DEAD. MOST OF HIGH COMMAND DEAD.”

FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

“FOUR DAYS LATER, GERMANY SURRENDERS.”

FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

“ONCE UPON A TIME IN NAZI . . .

OCCUPIED FRANCE.”

CUT TO:

EXT—WOODS—MORNING

It’s a misty early morning in a woodsy area. The German truck, with Aldo and Utivich in the back, and Landa and Herrman in the front, comes to a stop.

LANDA and HERRMAN IN THE TRUCK CAB

Herrman, behind the wheel, tells Landa in German:

HERRMAN:

These are the American lines, sir.

In the back of the truck sit the two last remaining members of the Basterds, Lt. Aldo Raine and Pfc. Smithson Utivich, both with their hands cuffed behind their backs.

Landa and Herrman appear at the truck rear. Landa says in ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA

Okay, gentlemen, you can climb down.

Aldo and Utivich climb down from the truck.

Col. Landa indicates for Herrman to remove the handcuffs from the two prisoners.

He does.

COL. LANDA

Herrman, hand them your weapon.

He does.

Col. Landa hands over his LUGER and his very-cool-looking S.S.

DAGGER.

COL. LANDA

I am officially surrendering myself

over to you, Lieutenant Raine. We are your prisoners.

LT. ALDO

Thank you very much, Colonel. Utivich, cuff the colonel’s hands behind his back.

COL. LANDA

Is that really necessary?

As Utivich cuffs the Colonel’s hands behind his back, Aldo says:

LT. ALDO

I’m a slave to appearances.

Then Aldo takes the Luger and SHOOTS HERRMAN DEAD.

The bound Col. Landa is appalled.

COL. LANDA

Are you mad? What have you done? I made a deal with your general for that man’s life!

LT. ALDO

Yeah, they made that deal, but they don’t give a fuck about him, they

need you.

COL. LANDA

You’ll be shot for this.

LT. ALDO

Naw, I don’t think so, more like I’ll

be chewed out. I’ve been chewed out before. You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass. End the war tonight? I’d make that deal. How ’bout you, Utivich, you make that deal?

UTIVICH:

I’d make that deal.

LT. ALDO

I don’t blame ya. Damn good deal. And that pretty little nest ya feathered for yourself. Well, if

you’re willing to barbecue the whole high command, I suppose that’s worth certain considerations. Now I don’t

care about you gettin’ pensions, merit badges, ticker-tape parades, who gives a damn, let’s all go home. But I do have one question.

When you go to your little place on Nantucket island, I imagine you gonna take off that handsome-looking S.S. uniform of yours, ain’t ya?

For the first time in the movie, Col. Landa doesn’t respond.

LT. ALDO

That’s what I thought. Now that . . .

. . . I can’t abide. How bout you, Utivich, can you abide it?

UTIVICH:

Not one damn bit, sir.

LT. ALDO

I mean if I had my way, you’d wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of our pecker-suckin’ life. But I’m aware that ain’t practical. I mean

at some point ya gotta hafta take it off.

He opens Landa’s S.S. DAGGER and holds the blade in front of Hans’s face.

LT. ALDO

So I’m gonna give you a little somethin you can’t take off.

CU COL. LANDA

The dagger has just completed carving a swastika deep into his forehead.

COL. LANDA’S POV

On the ground, looking up at Aldo, bloody knife in hand, who straddles him. And Utivich, who’s next to him. The two Basterds admire Aldo’s handiwork.

Aldo turns to Uitivich and says:

LT. ALDO

You know somethin’, Utivich? I think this just might be my masterpiece.

They ghoulishly giggle.

INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles.
It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed,
there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching
on bacon and eating eggs.

Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The
Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and,
like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're
going out of style.

It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or
how old she is; everything she does contradicts something
she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is
to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.

YOUNG MAN
No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm
through doin' that shit.

YOUNG WOMAN
You always say that, the same thing
every time: never again, I'm through,
too dangerous.

YOUNG MAN
I know that's what I always say. I'm
always right too, but –

YOUNG WOMAN
– but you forget about it in a day
or two -

YOUNG MAN
– yeah, well, the days of me
forgittin' are over, and the days of
me rememberin' have just begun.

YOUNG WOMAN
When you go on like this, you know
what you sound like?

YOUNG MAN
I sound like a sensible fucking man,
is what I sound like.

YOUNG WOMAN
You sound like a duck.
(imitates a duck)
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack...

YOUNG MAN
Well take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna hafta hear it again. Because
since I'm never gonna do it again,
you're never gonna hafta hear me
quack about how I'm never gonna do
it again.

YOUNG WOMAN
After tonight.

The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in
there, back and forth.

YOUNG MAN
(with a smile)
Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

WAITRESS
Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh yes, thank you.

The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man
lights up another cigarette.

YOUNG MAN
I'm doin' fine.

The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his
smoke.

The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her
coffee.

The Young Man goes right back into it.

YOUNG MAN
I mean the way it is now, you're
takin' the same fuckin' risk as when
you rob a bank. You take more of a
risk. Banks are easier! Federal
banks aren't supposed to stop you
anyway, during a robbery. They're
insured, why should they care? You
don't even need a gun in a federal
bank. I heard about this guy, walked
into a federal bank with a portable
phone, handed the phone to the teller,
the guy on the other end of the phone
said: "We got this guy's little girl,
and if you don't give him all your
money, we're gonna kill 'er."

YOUNG WOMAN
Did it work?

YOUNG MAN
Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm
talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in
a bank with a telephone, not a pistol,
not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone,
cleans the place out, and they don't
lift a fuckin' finger.

YOUNG WOMAN
Did they hurt the little girl?

YOUNG MAN
I don't know. There probably never
was a little girl – the point of the
story isn't the little girl. The
point of the story is they robbed
the bank with a telephone.

YOUNG WOMAN
You wanna rob banks?

YOUNG MAN
I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks,
I'm just illustrating that if we
did, it would be easier than what we
been doin'.

YOUNG WOMAN
So you don't want to be a bank robber?

YOUNG MAN
Naw, all those guys are goin' down
the same road, either dead or servin'
twenty.

YOUNG WOMAN
And no more liquor stores?

YOUNG MAN
What have we been talking about?
Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides,
it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too
many foreigners own liquor stores.
Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't
fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em:
"Empty out the register," and they
don't know what it fuckin' means.
They make it too personal. We keep
on, one of those gook motherfuckers'
gonna make us kill 'em.

YOUNG WOMAN
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

YOUNG MAN
I don't wanna kill anybody either.
But they'll probably put us in a
situation where it's us of them. And
if it's not the gooks, it these old
Jews who've owned the store for
fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got
Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the
counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try
walkin' into one of those stores
with nothin' but a telephone, see
how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget
it, we're out of it.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well, what else is there, day jobs?

YOUNG MAN
(laughing)
Not this life.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well what then?

He calls to the Waitress.

YOUNG MAN
Garcon! Coffee!

Then looks to his girl.

YOUNG MAN
This place.

The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.

WAITRESS
(snotty)
"Garcon" means boy.

She splits.

YOUNG WOMAN
Here? It's a coffee shop.

YOUNG MAN
What's wrong with that? People never
rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor
stores, gas stations, you get your
head blown off stickin' up one of
them. Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.
They're not expecting to get robbed,
or not as expecting.

YOUNG WOMAN
(taking to idea)
I bet in places like this you could
cut down on the hero factor.

YOUNG MAN
Correct. Just like banks, these places
are insured. The managers don't give
a fuck, they're just tryin' to get
ya out the door before you start
pluggin' diners. Waitresses, forget
it, they ain't takin' a bullet for
the register. Busboys, some wetback
gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour
gonna really give a fuck you're
stealin' from the owner. Customers
are sittin' there with food in their
mouths, they don't know what's goin'
on. One minute they're havin' a Denver
omelet, next minute somebody's
stickin' a gun in their face.

The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man
continues in a low voice.

YOUNG MAN
See, I got the idea last liquor store
we stuck up. 'Member all those
customers kept comin' in?

YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah.

YOUNG MAN
Then you got the idea to take
everybody's wallet.

YOUNG WOMAN
Uh-huh.

YOUNG MAN
That was a good idea.

YOUNG WOMAN
Thanks.

YOUNG MAN
We made more from the wallets then
we did the register.

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes we did.

YOUNG MAN
A lot of people go to restaurants.

YOUNG WOMAN
A lot of wallets.

YOUNG MAN
Pretty smart, huh?

The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new
information.

She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The
tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the
motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the
COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's
face.

YOUNG WOMAN
Pretty smart.
(into it)
I'm ready, let's go, right here,
right now.

YOUNG MAN
Remember, same as before, you're
crowd control, I handle the employees.

YOUNG WOMAN
Got it.

They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on
the table. He looks at her and she back at him.

YOUNG WOMAN
I love you, Pumpkin.

YOUNG MAN
I love you, Honey Bunny.

And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons,
stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona
is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is
that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.

PUMPKIN
(yelling to all)
Everybody be cool this is a robbery!

HONEY BUNNY
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
I'll execute every one of you
motherfuckers! Got that?

"PULP FICTION"

INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING

An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS
down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front
seat are two young fellas – one white, one black – both
wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long
green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES
WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.

JULES
– Okay now, tell me about the hash
bars?

VINCENT
What so you want to know?

JULES
Well, hash is legal there, right?

VINCENT
Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a
hundred percent legal. I mean you
can't walk into a restaurant, roll a
joint, and start puffin' away. You're
only supposed to smoke in your home
or certain designated places.

JULES
Those are hash bars?

VINCENT
Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's
legal to buy it, it's legal to own
it and, if you're the proprietor of
a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
It's legal to carry it, which doesn't
really matter 'cause – get a load of
this – if the cops stop you, it's
illegal for this to search you.
Searching you is a right that the
cops in Amsterdam don't have.

JULES
That did it, man – I'm fuckin' goin',
that's all there is to it.

VINCENT
You'll dig it the most. But you know
what the funniest thing about Europe
is?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
It's the little differences. A lotta
the same shit we got here, they got
there, but there they're a little
different.

JULES
Examples?

VINCENT
Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer
in a movie theatre. And I don't mean
in a paper cup either. They give you
a glass of beer, like in a bar. In
Paris, you can buy beer at
MacDonald's. Also, you know what
they call a Quarter Pounder with
Cheese in Paris?

JULES
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder
with Cheese?

VINCENT
No, they got the metric system there,
they wouldn't know what the fuck a
Quarter Pounder is.

JULES
What'd they call it?

VINCENT
Royale with Cheese.

JULES
(repeating)
Royale with Cheese. What'd they call
a Big Mac?

VINCENT
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call
it Le Big Mac.

JULES
Le Big Mac. What do they call a
Whopper?

VINCENT
I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger
King. But you know what they put on
french fries in Holland instead of
ketchup?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
Mayonnaise.

JULES
Goddamn!

VINCENT
I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a
little bit on the side of the plate,
they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

JULES
Uuccch!

CUT TO:

INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) – MORNING

The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach
inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking
them.

JULES
We should have shotguns for this
kind of deal.

VINCENT
How many up there?

JULES
Three or four.

VINCENT
Counting our guy?

JULES
I'm not sure.

VINCENT
So there could be five guys up there?

JULES
It's possible.

VINCENT
We should have fuckin' shotguns.

They CLOSE the trunk.

CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING

Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically
dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what
looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

We TRACK alongside.

VINCENT
What's her name?

JULES
Mia.

VINCENT
How did Marsellus and her meet?

JULES
I dunno, however people meet people.
She usta be an actress.

VINCENT
She ever do anything I woulda saw?

JULES
I think her biggest deal was she
starred in a pilot.

VINCENT
What's a pilot?

JULES
Well, you know the shows on TV?

VINCENT
I don't watch TV.

JULES
Yes, but you're aware that there's
an invention called television, and
on that invention they show shows?

VINCENT
Yeah.

JULES
Well, the way they pick the shows on
TV is they make one show, and that
show's called a pilot. And they show
that one show to the people who pick
the shows, and on the strength of
that one show, they decide if they
want to make more shows. Some get
accepted and become TV programs, and
some don't, and become nothing. She
starred in one of the ones that became
nothing.

They enter the apartment building.

INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) – MORNING

Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait
for the elevator.

JULES
You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-
black, half-Samoan, usta call him
Tony Rocky Horror.

VINCENT
Yeah maybe, fat right?

JULES
I wouldn't go so far as to call the
brother fat. He's got a weight
problem. What's the nigger gonna
do, he's Samoan.

VINCENT
I think I know who you mean, what
about him?

JULES
Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up
good. And word around the campfire,
it was on account of Marsellus
Wallace's wife.

The elevator arrives, the men step inside.

INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING

VINCENT
What'd he do, fuck her?

JULES
No no no no no no no, nothin' that
bad.

VINCENT
Well what then?

JULES
He gave her a foot massage.

VINCENT
A foot massage?

Jules nods his head: "Yes."

VINCENT
That's all?

Jules nods his head: "Yes."

VINCENT
What did Marsellus do?

JULES
Sent a couple of guys over to his
place. They took him out on the
patio of his apartment, threw his
ass over the balcony. Nigger fell
four stories. They had this garden
at the bottom, enclosed in glass,
like one of them greenhouses – nigger
fell through that. Since then, he's
kinda developed a speech impediment.

The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.

VINCENT
That's a damn shame.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING

STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline
down the hall.

VINCENT
Still I hafta say, play with matches,
ya get burned.

JULES
Whaddya mean?

VINCENT
You don't be givin' Marsellus
Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

JULES
You don't think he overreacted?

VINCENT
Antwan probably didn't expect
Marsellus to react like he did, but
he had to expect a reaction.

JULES
It was a foot massage, a foot massage
is nothing, I give my mother a foot
massage.

VINCENT
It's laying hands on Marsellus
Wallace's new wife in a familiar
way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out
– no, but you're in the same fuckin'
ballpark.

Jules stops Vincent.

JULES
Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right
there. Eatin' a bitch out, and givin'
a bitch a foot massage ain't even
the same fuckin' thing.

VINCENT
Not the same thing, the same ballpark.

JULES
It ain't no ballpark either. Look
maybe your method of massage differs
from mine, but touchin' his lady's
feet, and stickin' your tongue in
her holyiest of holyies, ain't the
same ballpark, ain't the same league,
ain't even the same fuckin' sport.
Foot massages don't mean shit.

VINCENT
Have you ever given a foot massage?

JULES
Don't be tellin' me about foot
massages – I'm the foot fuckin'
master.

VINCENT
Given a lot of 'em?

JULES
Shit yeah. I got my technique down
man, I don't tickle or nothin'.

VINCENT
Have you ever given a guy a foot
massage?

Jules looks at him a long moment – he's been set up.

JULES
Fuck you.

He starts walking down the hall. Vincent, smiling, walks a
little bit behind.

VINCENT
How many?

JULES
Fuck you.

VINCENT
Would you give me a foot massage –
I'm kinda tired.

JULES
Man, you best back off, I'm gittin'
pissed – this is the door.

The two men stand in front of the door numbered "49." They
whisper.

JULES
What time is it?

VINCENT
(checking his watch)
Seven-twenty-two in the morning.

JULES
It ain't quite time, let's hang back.

They move a little away from the door, facing each other,
still whispering.

JULES
Look, just because I wouldn't give
no man a foot massage, don't make it
right for Marsellus to throw Antwan
off a building into a glass-
motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the
way the nigger talks. That ain't
right, man. Motherfucker do that to
me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause
I'd kill'a motherfucker.

VINCENT
I'm not sayin' he was right, but
you're sayin' a foot massage don't
mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does.
I've given a million ladies a million
foot massages and they all meant
somethin'. We act like they don't,
but they do. That's what's so fuckin'
cool about 'em. This sensual thing's
goin' on that nobody's talkin about,
but you know it and she knows it,
fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan
shoulda known fuckin' better. That's
his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna
have a sense of humor about that
shit.

JULES
That's an interesting point, but
let's get into character.

VINCENT
What's her name again?

JULES
Mia. Why you so interested in big
man's wife?

VINCENT
Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida
and when he's gone, he wants me to
take care of Mia.

JULES
Take care of her?

Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.

VINCENT
Not that! Take her out. Show her a
good time. Don't let her get lonely.

JULES
You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace
out on a date?

VINCENT
It ain't a date. It's like when you
and your buddy's wife go to a movie
or somethin'. It's just... you know...
good company.

Jules just looks at him.

VINCENT
It's not a date.

Jules just looks at him.

INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING

THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a
table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.

One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to
REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.

JULES
Hey kids.

The two men stroll inside.

The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:

MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the
scene progresses, back into the corner.

ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of
Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the
table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in
their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.

JULES
How you boys doin'?

No answer.

JULES
(to Brett)
Am I trippin', or did I just ask you
a question.

BRETT
We're doin' okay.

As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

JULES
Do you know who we are?

Brett shakes his head: "No."

JULES
We're associates of your business
partner Marsellus Wallace, you
remember your business partner
dont'ya?

No answer.

JULES
(to Brett)
Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here:
you're Brett, right?

BRETT
I'm Brett.

JULES
I thought so. Well, you remember
your business partner Marsellus
Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

BRETT
I remember him.

JULES
Good for you. Looks like me and
Vincent caught you at breakfast,
sorry 'bout that. What'cha eatin'?

BRETT
Hamburgers.

JULES
Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any
nutritious breakfast. What kinda
hamburgers?

BRETT
Cheeseburgers.

JULES
No, I mean where did you get'em?
MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-
Box, where?

BRETT
Big Kahuna Burger.

JULES
Big Kahuna Burger. That's that
Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they
got some tasty burgers. I ain't never
had one myself, how are they?

BRETT
They're good.

JULES
Mind if I try one of yours?

BRETT
No.

JULES
Yours is this one, right?

BRETT
Yeah.

Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.

JULES
Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.
(to Vincent)
Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna
Burger?

VINCENT
No.

Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.

JULES
You wanna bite, they're real good.

VINCENT
I ain't hungry.

JULES
Well, if you like hamburgers give
'em a try sometime. Me, I can't
usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's
a vegetarian. Which more or less
makes me a vegetarian, but I sure
love the taste of a good burger.
(to Brett)
You know what they call a Quarter
Pounder with Cheese in France?

BRETT
No.

JULES
Tell 'em, Vincent.

VINCENT
Royale with Cheese.

JULES
Royale with Cheese, you know why
they call it that?

BRETT
Because of the metric system?

JULES
Check out the big brain on Brett.
You'a smart motherfucker, that's
right. The metric system.
(he points to a fast
food drink cup)
What's in this?

BRETT
Sprite.

JULES
Sprite, good, mind if I have some of
your tasty beverage to wash this
down with?

BRETT
Sure.

Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.

JULES
Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!
(to Roger)
You, Flock of Seagulls, you know
what we're here for?

Roger nods his head: "Yes."

JULES
Then why don't you tell my boy here
Vince, where you got the shit hid.

MARVIN
It's under the be –

JULES
– I don't remember askin' you a
goddamn thing.
(to Roger)
You were sayin'?

ROGER
It's under the bed.

Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out
a black snap briefcase.

VINCENT
Got it.

Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see
what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent
just stares at it, transfixed.

JULES
We happy?

No answer from the transfixed Vincent.

JULES
Vincent!

Vincent looks up at Jules.

JULES
We happy?

Closing the case.

VINCENT
We're happy.

BRETT
(to Jules)
Look, what's your name? I got his
name's Vincent, but what's yours?

JULES
My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin'
your ass outta this shit.

BRETT
I just want you to know how sorry we
are about how fucked up things got
between us and Mr. Wallace. When we
entered into this thing, we only had
the best intentions –

As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger
three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.

Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.

Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering,
but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

JULES
(to Brett)
Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your
concentration? I didn't mean to do
that. Please, continue. I believe
you were saying something about "best
intentions."

Brett can't say a word.

JULES
Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through
anyway. Well, let me retort. Would
you describe for me what Marsellus
Wallace looks like?

Brett still can't speak.

Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing
the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits
in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in
front of an interrogator.

JULES
What country you from!

BRETT
(petrified)
What?

JULES
"What" ain't no country I know! Do
they speak English in "What?"

BRETT
(near heart attack)
What?

JULES
English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-
it?

BRETT
Yes.

JULES
Then you understand what I'm sayin'?

BRETT
Yes.

JULES
Now describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

BRETT
(out of fear)
What?

Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's
cheek.

JULES
Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What"
again! I dare ya, I double dare ya
motherfucker, say "What" one more
goddamn time!

Brett is regressing on the spot.

JULES
Now describe to me what Marsellus
Wallace looks like!

Brett does his best.

BRETT
Well he's... he's... black –

JULES
– go on!

BRETT
...and he's... he's... bald –

JULES
– does he look like a bitch?!

BRETT
(without thinking)
What?

Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his
eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder.

Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in
the chair.

JULES
Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!

BRETT
(in agony)
No.

JULES
Then why did you try to fuck 'im
like a bitch?!

BRETT
(in spasm)
I didn't.

Now in a lower voice.

JULES
Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck
'im. You ever read the Bible, Brett?

BRETT
(in spasm)
Yes.

JULES
There's a passage I got memorized,
seems appropriate for this situation:
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness, for he is
truly his brother's keeper and the
finder of lost children. And I will
strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know my name
is the Lord when I lay my vengeance
upon you."

The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting
Brett.

We FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old
prizefighter. Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue
high school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is
everybody's boss MARSELLUS WALLACE. The black man sounds
like a cross between a gangster and a king.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
I think you're gonna find – when all
this shit is over and done – I think
you're gonna find yourself one smilin'
motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right
now you got ability. But painful as
it may be, ability don't last. Now
that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of
life, but it's a fact of life your
ass is gonna hafta git realistic
about. This business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic
motherfuckers who thought their ass
aged like wine. Besides, even if
you went all the way, what would you
be? Feather-weight champion of the
world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you
can even get a credit card based on
that.

A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front
of Butch. Butch picks it up.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Now the night of the fight, you may
fell a slight sting, that's pride
fuckin' wit ya. Fuck pride! Pride
only hurts, it never helps. Fight
through that shit. 'Cause a year
from now, when you're kickin' it in
the Caribbean you're gonna say,
"Marsellus Wallace was right."

BUTCH
I got no problem with that.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
In the fifth, your ass goes down.

Butch nods his head: "yes."

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Say it!

BUTCH
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

CUT TO:

INT. CAR (MOVING) – DAY

Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964
cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio,
ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT.

EXT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY

Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus
owns.

Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking
lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic.

Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked,
revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE.
Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin
Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally
LeRoy's.

ENGLISH DAVE
Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam,
git your ass on in here.

Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between
Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door
in our faces.

INT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY

The spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave
crosses to the bar, and Vince follows.

VINCENT
Where's the big man?

ENGLISH DAVE
He's over there, finishing up some
business.

VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with
his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of
yet still UNSEEN Marsellus.

ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
Hang back for a second or two, and
when you see the white boy leave, go
on over. In the meanwhile, can I
make you an espresso?

VINCENT
How 'bout a cup of just plain lo'
American?

ENGLISH DAVE
Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia
out tomorrow?

VINCENT
At Marsellus' request.

ENGLISH DAVE
Have you met Mia?

VINCENT
Not yet.

English Dave smiles to himself.

VINCENT
What's so funny?

ENGLISH DAVE
Not a goddamn thing.

VINCENT
Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big
man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit
across a table, chew my food with my
mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and
that's all I'm gonna do.

English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.

ENGLISH DAVE
My name's Paul, and this is between
y'all.

Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his
cup of "Plain ol' American."

BUTCH
(to English Dave)
Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?

ENGLISH DAVE
Filters?

BUTCH
Non.

While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his
coffee, staring at him. Butch looks over at him.

BUTCH
Lookin' at somethin', friend?

VINCENT
I ain't your friend, palooka.

Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.

BUTCH
What was that?

VINCENT
I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.

Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Vincent Vega has entered the building,
git your ass over here!

Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another
glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME,
looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching
business.

BUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure
that is Marsellus.

Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend
of Marsellus, he better let it go – for now.

ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.

Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays
English Dave and walks out of the SHOT.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) – NIGHT

CLOSEUP – JODY

A woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. Both of
her ears are pierced five times. She also sports rings in
her lips, eyebrows and nose.

JODY
...I'll lend it to you. It's a great
book on body piercing.

Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen
table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is
at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.

TRUDI
You know how they use that gun when
they pierce your ears? They don't
use that when they pierce your
nipples, do they?

JODY
Forget that gun. That gun goes against
the entire idea behind piercing. All
of my piercing, sixteen places on my
body, every one of 'em done with a
needle. Five in each ear. One through
the nipple on my left breast. One
through my right nostril. One through
my left eyebrow. One through my lip.
One in my clit. And I wear a stud in
my tongue.

Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear
and out the other, until that last remark.

VINCENT
(interrupting)
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm
curious, why would you get a stud in
your tongue?

Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious
thing in the world.

JODY
It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.

That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it
makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent
to ponder the truth of her statement.

LANCE (O.S.)
Vince, you can come in now!

INT. LANCE'S BEDROOM – NIGHT

Lance, late 20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly
appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly
personality. LANCE has been selling drugs his entire adult
life. He's never had a day job, never filed a tax return and
has never been arrested. He wears a red flannel shirt over a
"Speed Racer" tee-shirt.

Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed.

Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed.

LANCE
Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very
good stuff. This is Bava, different,
but equally good. And this is Choco
from the Hartz Mountains of Germany.
Now the first two are the same, forty-
five an ounce – those are friend
prices – but this one...
(pointing to the Choco)
...this one's a little more expensive.
It's fifty-five. But when you shoot
it, you'll know where that extra
money went. Nothing wrong with the
first two. It's real, real, real,
good shit. But this one's a fuckin'
madman.

VINCENT
Remember, I just got back from
Amsterdam.

LANCE
Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood?
No. You're in my house. White people
who know the difference between good
shit and bad shit, this is the house
they come to. My shit, I'll take the
Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit
any ol' day of the fuckin' week.

VINCENT
That's a bold statement.

LANCE
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is
a seller's market. Coke is fuckin'
dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole
seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin,
they're as hot as hell.

Vincent takes out a roll of money that would choke a horse
to death.

VINCENT
Give me three hundred worth of the
madman. If it's as good as you say,
I'll be back for a thousand.

LANCE
I just hope I still have it. Whaddya
think of Trudi? She ain't got a
boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get
high?

VINCENT
Which one's Trudi? The one with all
the shit in her face?

LANCE
No, that's Jody. That's my wife.

Vincent and Lance giggle at the "faux pas."

VINCENT
I'm on my way somewhere. I got a
dinner engagement. Rain check?

LANCE
No problem?

Vincent takes out his case of the works (utensils for shooting
up).

VINCENT
You don't mind if I shoot up here?

LANCE
Me casa, su casa.

VINCENT
Mucho gracias.

Vincent takes his works out of his case and, as the two
continue to talk, Vince shoots up.

LANCE
Still got your Malibu?

VINCENT
You know what some fucker did to it
the other day?

LANCE
What?

VINCENT
Fuckin' keyed it.

LANCE
Oh man, that's fucked up.

VINCENT
Tell me about it. I had the goddamn
thing in storage three years. It's
out five fuckin' days – five days,
and some dickless piece of shit fucks
with it.

LANCE
They should be fuckin' killed. No
trial, no jury, straight to execution.

As he cooks his heroin...

VINCENT
I just wish I caught 'em doin' it,
ya know? Oh man, I'd give anything
to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been
worth his doin' it, if I coulda just
caught 'em, you know what I mean?

LANCE
It's chicken shit. You don't fuck
another man's vehicle.

CLOSEUP – THE NEEDLE

Going into Vincent's vein.

CLOSEUP – BLOOD

Spurting back into the syringe, mixing with the heroin.

CLOSEUP – VINCENT'S THUMB

Pushing down on the plunger.

CUT TO:

EXT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

Vincent walks toward the house and pulls a note off the door

CLOSEUP – NOTE

The Note reads:

"Hi Vincent, I'm getting dressed. The door's open. Come inside
and make yourself a drink. Mia"

MIA (V.O.)
Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed.
The door's open. Come inside and
make yourself a drink.

FADE TO WHITE

Music in.

FADE TO:

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent enters on the background.

VINCENT
Hello?

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA, Marcellus' beautiful young wife. Video screens are in
the background. Dusty Springfield is singing "SON OF A
PREACHER MAN".

Mia's mouth comes toward a microphone.

MIA
(into microphone)
Vincent.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent turns.

MIA
(over intercom)
Vincent. I'm on the intercom.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(into microphone)
It's on the wall by the two African
fellas.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(over intercom)
To your right.

Vincent walks.

MIA
...warm. Warmer. Disco.

Vincent finds the intercom on the wall.

VINCENT
Hello.

MIA
(over intercom)
Push the button if you want to talk.

VINCENT
(into intercom)
Hello.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(into microphone)
Go make yourself a drink., and I'll
be down in two shakes of a lamb's
tail.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(over intercom)
The bar's by the fireplace.

VINCENT
(into intercom)
Okay.
(licks lips)

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

A video screen with an image of Vincent, walking. The Dusty
Springfield song continues.

Mia turns a knob which controls the movement of the video
camera in Marcellus' living room.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent picks up a bottle of scotch. He sniffs the bottle,
and then pours it into a glass.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

A razor blade cuts cocaine on a mirror.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent drinks a glass of scotch.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

Mia sniffs the cocaine.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent sips the drink and looks at a portrait of Mia on the
wall.

Mia walks into the room, and takes the needle off a record.
The Dusty Springfield song stops.

MIA
Let's go.

EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT

In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over
L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're
all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book,
Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer,
saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the
Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and
over prices that pay for all this bullshit.

But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's
diners.

Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of
view.

Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with
a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a
red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath
the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that
is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."

VINCENT
What the fuck is this place?

MIA
This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis
man should love it.

VINCENT
Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.

MIA
You can get a steak here, daddy-o.
Don't be a...

Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on
the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.

VINCENT
After you, kitty-cat.

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT

Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint
English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over
the wall

("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF
THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that
the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s
cars.

In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign
on the wall states, "No shoes allowed." Some wannabe beboppers
(actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or
barefeet.

The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead,
B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The
WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons:
MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and
LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing
appropriate costumes.

Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red
'59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting
a big button on his chest that says: "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing
you please me."

BUDDY
Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?

VINCENT
I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

BUDDY
How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp,
or bloody as hell?

VINCENT
Bloody as hell. And to drink, a
vanilla coke.

BUDDY
How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?

MIA
I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger –
bloody – and a five-dollar shake.

BUDDY
How d'ya want that shake, Martin and
Lewis, or Amos and Andy?

MIA
Martin and Lewis.

VINCENT
Did you just order a five-dollar
shake?

MIA
Sure did.

VINCENT
A shake? Milk and ice cream?

MIA
Uh-huh.

VINCENT
It costs five dollars?

BUDDY
Yep.

VINCENT
You don't put bourbon in it or
anything?

BUDDY
Nope.

VINCENT
Just checking.

Buddy exits.

Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are
dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers,
and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing,
The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her
customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a
fool.

MIA
Whaddya think?

VINCENT
It's like a wax museum with a pulse
rate.

Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling
himself a smoke.

After a second of watching him –

MIA
What are you doing?

VINCENT
Rollin' a smoke.

MIA
Here?

VINCENT
It's just tobacco.

MIA
Oh. Well in that case, will you roll
me one, cowboy?

As he finishes licking it –

VINCENT
You can have this one, cowgirl.

He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to
her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's
hand. He lights it.

MIA
Thanks.

VINCENT
Think nothing of it.

He begins rolling one for himself.

As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner,
making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a
square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS
the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out
a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.

Back to Mia and Vincent.

MIA
Marsellus said you just got back
from Amsterdam.

VINCENT
Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.

MIA
That was my fifteen minutes.

VINCENT
What was it?

MIA
It was show about a team of female
secret agents called "Fox Force Five."

VINCENT
What?

MIA
"Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a
bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in
we're a force to be reckoned with.
Five, as in there's one... two ...
three... four... five of us. There
was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal
from that show "Baton Rouge," she
was the leader. A Japanese one, a
black one, a French one and a brunette
one, me. We all had special skills.
Sommerset had a photographic memory,
the Japanese fox was a kung fu master,
the black girl was a demolition
expert, the French fox' specialty
was sex...

VINCENT
What was your specialty?

MIA
Knives. The character I played, Raven
McCoy, her background was she was
raised by circus performers. So she
grew up doing a knife act. According
to the show, she was the deadliest
woman in the world with a knife. But
because she grew up in a circus, she
was also something of an acrobat.
She could do illusions, she was a
trapeze artist – when you're keeping
the world safe from evil, you never
know when being a trapeze artist's
gonna come in handy. And she knew a
zillion old jokes her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her. If
we woulda got picked up, they woulda
worked in a gimmick where every
episode I woulda told and ol joke.

VINCENT
Do you remember any of the jokes?

MIA
Well I only got the chance to say
one, 'cause we only did one show.

VINCENT
Tell me.

MIA
No. It's really corny.

VINCENT
C'mon, don't be that way.

MIA
No. You won't like it and I'll be
embarrassed.

VINCENT
You told it in front of fifty million
people and you can't tell it to me?
I promise I won't laugh.

MIA
(laughing)
That's what I'm afraid of.

VINCENT
That's not what I meant and you know
it.

MIA
You're quite the silver tongue devil,
aren't you?

VINCENT
I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.

MIA
That's not what you said Vince. Well
now I'm definitely not gonna tell
ya, 'cause it's been built up too
much.

VINCENT
What a gyp.

Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around
the straw of her shake.

MIA
Yummy!

VINCENT
Can I have a sip of that? I'd like
to know what a five-dollar shake
tastes like.

MIA
Be my guest.

She slides the shake over to him.

MIA
You can use my straw, I don't have
kooties.

Vincent smiles.

VINCENT
Yeah, but maybe I do.

MIA
Kooties I can handle.

He takes a sip.

VINCENT
Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin'
good milk shake.

MIA
Told ya.

VINCENT
I don't know if it's worth five
dollars, but it's pretty fuckin'
good.

He slides the shake back.

Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.

MIA
Don't you hate that?

VINCENT
What?

MIA
Uncomfortable silences. Why do we
feel it's necessary to yak about
bullshit in order to be comfortable?

VINCENT
I don't know.

MIA
That's when you know you found
somebody special. When you can just
shit the fuck up for a minute, and
comfortably share silence.

VINCENT
I don't think we're there yet. But
don't feel bad, we just met each
other.

MIA
Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to
the bathroom and powder my nose,
while you sit here and think of
something to say.

VINCENT
I'll do that.

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM) – NIGHT

Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the
bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.

MIA
(imitating Steppenwolf)
I said goddamn!

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT

Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his
eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.

Mia comes back to the table.

MIA
Don't you love it when you go to the
bathroom and you come back to find
your food waiting for you?

VINCENT
We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy
Holly doesn't seem to be much of a
waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn
Monroe's section.

MIA
Which one, there's two Marilyn
Monroes.

VINCENT
No there's not.

Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.

VINCENT
That's Marilyn Monroe...

Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and
capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS –

VINCENT
... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I
don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it
must be her night off.

MIA
Pretty smart.

VINCENT
I have moments.

MIA
Did ya think of something to say?

VINCENT
Actually, there's something I've
wanted to ask you about, but you
seem like a nice person, and I didn't
want to offend you.

MIA
Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like
mindless, boring, getting-to-know-
you chit-chat. This sounds like you
actually have something to say.

VINCENT
Only if you promise not to get
offended.

MIA
You can't promise something like
that. I have no idea what you're
gonna ask. You could ask me what
you're gonna ask me, and my natural
response could be to be offended.
Then, through no fault of my own, I
woulda broken my promise.

VINCENT
Then let's just forget it.

MIA
That is an impossibility. Trying to
forget anything as intriguing as
this would be an exercise in futility.

VINCENT
Is that a fact?

Mia nods her head: "Yes."

MIA
Besides, it's more exciting when you
don't have permission.

VINCENT
What do you think about what happened
to Antwan?

MIA
Who's Antwan?

VINCENT
Tony Rocky Horror.

MIA
He fell out of a window.

VINCENT
That's one way to say it. Another
way is, he was thrown out. Another
was is, he was thrown out by
Marsellus. And even another way is,
he was thrown out of a window by
Marsellus because of you.

MIA
Is that a fact?

VINCENT
No it's not, it's just what I heard.

MIA
Who told you this?

VINCENT
They.

Mia and Vincent smile.

MIA
They talk a lot, don't they?

VINCENT
They certainly do.

MIA
Well don't by shy Vincent, what
exactly did they say?

Vincent is slow to answer.

MIA
Let me help you Bashful, did it
involve the F-word?

VINCENT
No. They just said Rocky Horror gave
you a foot massage.

MIA
And...?

VINCENT
No and, that's it.

MIA
You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror
out of a four-story window because
he massaged my feet?

VINCENT
Yeah.

MIA
And you believed that?

VINCENT
At the time I was told, it seemed
reasonable.

MIA
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a
four story window for giving me a
foot massage seemed reasonable?

VINCENT
No, it seemed excessive. But that
doesn't mean it didn't happen. I
heard Marsellus is very protective
of you.

MIA
A husband being protective of his
wife is one thing. A husband almost
killing another man for touching his
wife's feet is something else.

VINCENT
But did it happen?

MIA
The only thing Antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand, when he shook
it. I met Anwan once – at my wedding
– then never again. The truth is,
nobody knows why Marsellus tossed
Tony Rocky Horror out of that window
except Marsellus and Tony Rocky
Horror. But when you scamps get
together, you're worse than a sewing
circle.

CUT TO:

ED SULLIVAN AND MARILYN MONROE STAND ON STAGE

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment
you've all been waiting for, the
worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist
contest.

Patrons cheer.

Ed Sullivan is with Marilyn Monroe, who holds a trophy.

ED SULLIVAN
...One lucky couple will win this
handsome trophy that Marilyn here is
holding.

Marilyn holds the trophy.

ED SULLIVAN
...Now, who will be our first
contestants?

Mia holds her hand.

MIA
Right here.

Vincent reacts.

MIA
I wanna dance.

VINCENT
No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.

MIA
(overlapping)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do
believe Marsellus, my husband, your
boss, told you to take me out and do
whatever I wanted, Now, I want to
dance. I want to win. I want that
trophy.

VINCENT
(sighs)
All right.

MIA
So, dance good.

VINCENT
All right, you asked for it.

Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
Let's hear it for our first
contestants.

Patrons cheer.

Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.

ED SULLIVAN
Now let's meet our first contestants
here this evening. Young lady, what
is your name?

MIA
(into microphone)
Missus Mia Wallace.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?

MIA
(into microphone)
Vincent Vega.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
All right, let's see what you can
do. Take it away!

Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL".
They make hand movements as they dance.

INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME – NIGHT

The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-
style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the
previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.

Then...

The two just stand face to face looking at each other.

VINCENT
Was than an uncomfortable silence?

MIA
I don't know what that was.
(pause)
Music and drinks!

Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his
overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.

VINCENT
I'm gonna take a piss.

MIA
That was a little bit more information
than I needed to know, but go right
ahead.

Vincent shuffles off to the john.

Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs
and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high
energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She
dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's
overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It
feels good.

Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch.
Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco
on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks
the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a
little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so
anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out
his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg,
trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you
know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly
brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up,
then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.

The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she
takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in
the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something
else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder
inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance.
Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her
face.

MIA
(like you would say
Bingo!)
Disco! Vince, you little cola nut,
you've been holding out on me.

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) – NIGHT

Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to
himself in the mirror.

VINCENT
One drink and leave. Don't be rude,
but drink your drink quickly, say
goodbye, walk out the door, get in
your car, and go down the road.

LIVING ROOM

Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines
on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred
dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the
fat line.

CLOSEUP – MIA

Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels
like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong.
Then... the rush hits...

BATHROOM

Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his
dialogue with the mirror.

VINCENT
...It's a moral test of yourself,
whether or not you can maintain
loyalty. Because when people are
loyal to each other, that's very
meaningful.

LIVING ROOM

Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but
it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from
her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her
stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.

BATHROOM

Vince continues.

VINCENT
So you're gonna go out there, drink
your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had
a very lovely evening," go home, and
jack off. And that's all you're
gonna do.

Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's
ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of
that door. So he goes through it.

LIVING ROOM

We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to
the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like
a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are
down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the
tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her
face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open.
Slack-jawed.

VINCENT
Jesus Christ!

Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body.
Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck
to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.

Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.

VINCENT
(sounding weird)
Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?

But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles,
but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.

Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.

VINCENT
(to himself)
I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
(to Mia)
Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer
me honey, what did you take?

Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.

Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the
rack.

He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent
makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.

VINCENT
(yelling to Mia)
Okay honey, we're getting you on
your feet.

He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.

VINCENT
We're on our feet now, and now we're
gonna talk out to the car. Here we
go, watch us walk.

We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-
unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.

EXT. VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT

INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.

Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws,
speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.

INT.VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT

Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting
like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when
he glances over at Mia.

Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag
of water.

Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches
a number.

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant
drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.

He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-
out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT,
CALIFORNIA", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand
is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of
him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n
Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in
an ashtray.

On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three
Stooges, and they're getting married.

PREACHER (EMIL SIMKUS)
(on TV)
Hold hands, you love birds.

The phone RINGS.

Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.

It RINGS again.

Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.

JODY (O.S.)
Lance! The phone's ringing!

LANCE
(calling back)
I can hear it!

JODY (O.S.)
I thought you told those fuckin'
assholes never to call this late!

LANCE
(by the phone)
I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna
tell this fuckin' asshole right now!
(he answers the phone)
Hello, do you know how late it is?
You're not supposed to be callin' me
this fuckin' late.

BACK TO:

VINCENT IN THE MALIBU

Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching
the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the
conversation.

VINCENT
Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big
fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way
to your place.

LANCE
Whoa, hold you horses man, what's
the problem?

VINCENT
You still got an adrenaline shot?

LANCE
(dawning on him)
Maybe.

VINCENT
I need it man, I got a chick she's
fuckin' Doing on me.

LANCE
Don't bring her here! I'm not even
fuckin' joking with you, don't you
be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt
to my house!

VINCENT
No choice.

LANCE
She's ODin'?

VINCENT
Yeah. She's dyin'.

LANCE
Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take
'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!

VINCENT
Negative.

LANCE
She ain't my fuckin' problem, you
fucked her up, you deal with it –
are you talkin' to me on a cellular
phone?

VINCENT
Sorry.

LANCE
I don't know you, who is this, don't
come here, I'm hangin' up.

VINCENT
Too late, I'm already here.

At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu
coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his
curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH
in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn
and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out
of SHATTERS from the impact.

JODY (O.S.)
What the hell was that?

Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front
lawn.

EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia
out.

LANCE
Have you lost your mind?! You crashed
your car in my fuckin' house! You
talk about drug shit on a cellular
fuckin' phone –

VINCENT
If you're through havin' your little
hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get
your needle and git it now!

LANCE
Are you deaf? You're not bringin'
that fucked up bitch in my house!

VINCENT
This fucked up bitch is Marsellus
Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin'
croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But
before he turns me into a bar soap,
I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about
how you coulda saved her life, but
instead you let her die on your front
lawn.

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.

Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's
wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone
on it.

We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking
through the hall into the living room.

JODY
It's only one-thirty in the goddamn
mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on
out here?

As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance
standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of
the room.

From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a
DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference
here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.

JODY
Who's she?

Lance looks up at Jody.

LANCE
Get that black box in the bedroom I
have with the adrenaline shot.

JODY
What's wrong with her?

VINCENT
She's ODing on us.

JODY
Well get her the hell outta here!

LANCE AND VINCENT
(in stereo)
Get the fuckin' shot!

JODY
Don't yell and me!

She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking
for the shot.

WE MOVE into the room with the two men.

VINCENT
(to Lance)
You two are a match made in heaven.

LANCE
Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay?
While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta
get a medical book.

VINCENT
What do you need a medical book for?

LANCE
To tell me how to do it. I've never
given an adrenaline shot before.

VINCENT
You've had that thing for six years
and you never used it?

LANCE
I never had to use it. I don't go
joypoppin' with bubble-gummers, all
of my friends can handle their highs!

VINCENT
Well then get it.

LANCE
I am, if you'll let me.

VINCENT
I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.

LANCE
Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin'
to her.

WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a...

INT. SPARE ROOM

With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning
the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words,
"Come on," endlessly.

From OFF SCREEN we hear:

VINCENT (O.S.)
Hurry up man! We're losin' her!

LANCE
(calling back)
I'm looking as fast as I can!

Lance continues his frenzied search.

WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.

JODY (O.S.)
What's he lookin' for?

VINCENT (O.S.)
I dunno, some medical book.

Jody calls to LANCE.

JODY (O.S.)
What are you lookin' for?

LANCE
My black medical book!

As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit,
Jody appears in the doorway.

JODY
Whata're you looking for?

LANCE
My black fuckin' medical book. It's
like a text book they give to nurses.

JODY
I never saw a medical book.

LANCE
Trust me, I have one.

JODY
Well if it's that important, why
didn't you keep it with the shot?

Lance spins toward her.

LANCE
I don't know! Stop bothering me!

JODY
While you're lookin' for it, that
girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're
never gonna find it in all this shit.
For six months now, I've been telling
you to clean this room –

VINCENT (O.S.)
– get your ass in here, fuck the
book!

Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT
heading for the living room.

LIVING ROOM

Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance
reenters the room.

VINCENT
Quit fuckin' around man and give her
the shot!

Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He
opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.

LANCE
While I'm doing this, take her shirt
off and find her heart.

Vince rips her blouse open.

Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.

VINCENT
Does it have to be exact?

LANCE
Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving
her an injection in the heart, so I
gotta exactly hit her in the heart.

VINCENT
Well, I don't know exactly where her
heart is, I think it's here.

Vince points to Mia's right breast. Lance glances over and
nods.

LANCE
That's it.

As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.

VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, got
one?

JODY
What?

VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, any
felt pen'll do, but a magic marker
would be great.

JODY
Hold on.

Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her
enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents
of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.

The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.

LANCE
It's ready, I'll tell you what to
do.

VINCENT
You're gonna give her the shot.

LANCE
No, you're gonna give her the shot.

VINCENT
I've never does this before.

LANCE
I've never done this before either,
and I ain't starting now. You brought
'er here, that means you give her
the shot. The day I bring an ODing
bitch to your place, then I gotta
give her the shot.

Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic
marker in her hand.

JODY
Got it.

Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes
a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.

VINCENT
Okay, what do I do?

LANCE
Well, you're giving her an injection
of adrenaline straight to her heart.
But she's got a breast plate in front
of her heart, so you gotta pierce
through that. So what you gotta do
is bring the needle down in a stabbing
motion.

Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The
Shape" killing its victims in "HALLOWEEN".

VINCENT
I gotta stab her?

LANCE
If you want the needle to pierce
through to her heart, you gotta stab
her hard.

Then once you do, push down on the plunger.

VINCENT
What happens after that?

LANCE
I'm curious about that myself.

VINCENT
This ain't a fuckin' joke man!

LANCE
She's supposed to come out of it
like –
(snaps his fingers)
– that.

Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing
motion.

He looks down on Mia.

Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.

Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.

VINCENT
Count to three.

Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know
what to expect.

LANCE
One...

RED DOT on Mia's body.

Needle raised ready to strike.

LANCE (O.S.)
...two...

Jody's face is alive with anticipation.

NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.

LANCE (O.S.)
...three!

The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.

Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the
chest.

Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.

The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline
out through the needle.

Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of
the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck
in her chest – SCREAMING.

Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in
front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.

Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of
air.

The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken
to their bones, look to see if she's alright.

LANCE
If you're okay, say something.

Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a
relatively normal voice.

MIA
Something.

Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and
shaking from how close to death Mia came.

JODY
Anybody want a beer?

CUT TO:

INT. VINCENT'S MALIBU (MOVING) – NIGHT

Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says
anything, both are still too shaken.

EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying
a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway
toward her front door.

VINCENT (O.S.)
Mia!

She turns around.

Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big
distance between the two.

VINCENT
What are your thoughts on how to
handle this?

MIA
What's yours?

VINCENT
Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus
can live his whole live and never
ever hear of this incident.

Mia smiles.

MIA
Don't worry about it. If Marsellus
ever heard of this, I'd be in as
much trouble as you.

VINCENT
I seriously doubt that.

MIA
If you can keep a secret, so can I.

VINCENT
Let's shake on it.

The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to
shake and shake they do.

VINCENT
Mum's the word.

Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-
evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.

Vincent smiles.

VINCENT
If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home
and have a heart attack.

Mia giggles.

Vincent turns to leave.

MIA
You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE
FIVE" joke?

Vincent turns around.

VINCENT
Sure, but I think I'm still a little
too petrified to laugh.

MIA
Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's
not funny. But if you still wanna
hear it, I'll tell it.

VINCENT
I can't wait.

MIA
Three tomatoes are walking down the
street, a poppa tomato, a momma
tomato, and a little baby tomato.
The baby tomato is lagging behind
the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa
tomato gets mad, goes over to the
momma tomato and stamps on him –
(stamps on the ground)
– and says: catch up.

They both smile, but neither laugh.

MIA
See ya 'round, Vince.

Mia turns and walks inside her house.

CLOSEUP – VINCENT

After Mia walks inside. Vincent continues to look at where
she was. He brings his hands to his lips and blows her a
kiss. Then exits FRAME leaving it empty. WE HEAR his Malibu
START UP and DRIVE AWAY.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP On the cartoon "SPEED RACER." Speed is giving a
detailed description of all the features on his race car
"The Mac-5," which he does at the beginning of every episode.

OFF SCREEN we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE... .

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Butch.

DISSOLVE TO:

BUTCH'S POV

We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in
Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish,
stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to
her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force
officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old
boy.

MOTHER
Butch, stop watching TV a second. We
got a special visitor. Now do you
remember when I told you your daddy
dies in a P.O.W. camp?

BUTCH (O.S.)
Uh-huh.

MOTHER
Well this here is Capt. Koons. He
was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and
bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's
eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas
accent.

CAPT. KOONS
Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard
a bunch about you. See, I was a good
friend of your Daddy's. We were in
that Hanoi pit of hell over five
years together. Hopefully, you'll
never have to experience this
yourself, but when two men are in a
situation like me and your Daddy
were, for as long as we were, you
take on certain responsibilities of
the other. If it had been me who had
not made it, Major Coolidge would be
talkin' right now to my son Jim. But
the way it worked out is I'm talkin'
to you, Butch. I got somethin' for
ya.

The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.

CAPT. KOONS
This watch I got here was first
purchased by your great-granddaddy.
It was bought during the First World
War in a little general store in
Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought
by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge
the day he set sail for Paris. It
was your great-granddaddy's war watch,
made by the first company to ever
make wrist watches. You see, up until
then, people just carried pocket
watches. Your great-granddaddy wore
that watch every day he was in the
war. Then when he had done his duty,
he went home to your great-
grandmother, took the watch off his
wrist and put it in an ol' coffee
can. And in that can it stayed 'til
your grandfather Dane Coolidge was
called upon by his country to go
overseas and fight the Germans once
again. This time they called it World
War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave
it to your granddad for good luck.
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as
good as his old man's. Your granddad
was a Marine and he was killed with
all the other Marines at the battle
of Wake Island. Your granddad was
facing death and he knew it. None of
those boys had any illusions about
ever leavin' that island alive. So
three days before the Japanese took
the island, your 22-year old
grandfather asked a gunner on an Air
Force transport named Winocki, a man
he had never met before in his life,
to deliver to his infant son, who he
had never seen in the flesh, his
gold watch. Three days later, your
grandfather was dead. But Winocki
kept his word. After the war was
over, he paid a visit to your
grandmother, delivering to your infant
father, his Dad's gold watch. This
watch. This watch was on your Daddy's
wrist when he was shot down over
Hanoi. He was captured and put in a
Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew
if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd
be confiscated. The way your Daddy
looked at it, that watch was your
birthright. And he'd be damned if
and slopeheads were gonna put their
greasy yella hands on his boy's
birthright. So he hid it in the one
place he knew he could hide somethin'.
His ass. Five long years, he wore
this watch up his ass. Then when he
died of dysentery, he gave me the
watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass for two years.
Then, after seven years, I was sent
home to my family. And now, little
man, I give the watch to you.

Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes
into FRAME to accept it.

CUT TO:

INT. LOCKER ROOM – NIGHT

The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia:
trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few
zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to
him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory,
he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.

His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a
little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to
be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.

KLONDIKE
It's time, Butch.

BUTCH
I'm ready.

Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB
outside.

He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch
hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him
on with the robe, which says on the back: "BATTLING BUTCH
COOLIDGE".

The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for
Butch.

As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit.
Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet,
empty locker room.

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE CARD:

"THE GOLD WATCH"

We hear over the black and white title:

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
– Well Dan, that had to be the
bloodiest and, hands-down, the most
brutal fight this city has ever seen.

The SOUND of chaos in the b.g.

FADE IN:

EXT. ALLEY (RAINING) – NIGHT

A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. The
sky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked
car. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from
inside.

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
...Coolidge was out of there faster
than I've ever seen a victorious
boxer vacate the ring. Do you think
he knew Willis was dead?

SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
My guess would be yes, Richard. I
could see from my position here, the
frenzy in his eyes give way to the
realization of what he was doing. I
think any man would've left the ring
that fast.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TAXI (PARKED/RAINING) – NIGHT

Inside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named
ESMARELDA VILLALOBOS. A young woman, with Spanish looks,
sits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a
white styrofoam cup.

The Sportscasters continue their coverage.

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
Do you feel this ring death tragedy
will have an effect on the world of
boxing?

SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't
help but shake the world of boxing
to its very foundation. But it's of
paramount importance that during the
sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the
W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the –

CLICK – Esmarelda shuts off the radio.

She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in
the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:

EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT

A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-
side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage
dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed
in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to
the dumpster below.

ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.

Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS
to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and
throws it to the ground.

INT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING) – NIGHT

Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves,
HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.

Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through
the rearview mirror:

ESMARELDA
(Spanish accent)
Are you the man I was supposed to
pick up?

BUTCH
If you're the cab I called, I'm the
guy you're supposed to pick up.

ESMARELDA
Where to?

BUTCH
Outta here.

The ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life.

The meter is FLIPPED on.

Esmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal.

EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT

The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet
pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.

INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM) – NIGHT

Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through
the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall,
shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave
takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by
the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.

VINCENT
Mia. How you doin'?

MIA
Great. I never thanked you for the
dinner.

In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table –
dead.

His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is
on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.

The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table,
hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support.
We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.

Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.

Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
What'cha got?

ENGLISH DAVE
He booked.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
I'm prepared to scour the earth for
this motherfucker. If Butch goes to
Indo China, I want a nigger hidin'
in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a
cap in his ass.

ENGLISH DAVE
I'll take care of it.

INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) – NIGHT

Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.

Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.

He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't
find the roll bar.

BUTCH
Hey, how do I open the window back
here?

ESMARELDA
I have to do it.

She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch
tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying
the other one.

Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.

ESMARELDA
Hey, mister?

BUTCH
(still working on the
glove)
What?

ESMARELDA
You were in that fight? The fight on
the radio – you're the fighter?

As he tosses his other glove out the window.

BUTCH
Whatever gave you that idea?

ESMARELDA
No c'mon, you're him, I know you're
him, tell me you're him.

BUTCH
(drying himself with
a gym towel)
I'm him.

ESMARELDA
You killed the other boxing man.

BUTCH
He's dead?

ESMARELDA
The radio said he was dead.

He finished wiping himself down.

BUTCH
(to himself)
Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.

He tosses the towel out the window.

Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.

ESMARELDA
What does it feel like?

BUTCH
(finds his shirt)
What does what feel like?

ESMARELDA
Killing a man. Beating another man
to death with your bare hands.

Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.

BUTCH
Are you some kinda weirdo?

ESMARELDA
No, it's a subject I have much
interest in. You are the first person
I ever met who has killed somebody.
So, what was it like to kill a man?

BUTCH
Tell ya what, you give me one of
them cigarettes, I'll give you an
answer.

Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement.

ESMARELDA
Deal!

Butch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road,
passes a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not
looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in
it.

Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.

He takes a long drag.

BUTCH
So...

He looks at her license.

BUTCH
...Esmarelda Villalobos – is that
Mexican?

ESMARELDA
The name is Spanish, but I'm
Columbian.

BUTCH
It's a very pretty name.

ESMARELDA
It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."

BUTCH
That's one hell of a name you got
there, sister.

ESMARELDA
Thank you. And what is your name?

BUTCH
Butch.

ESMARELDA
Butch. What does it mean?

BUTCH
I'm an American, our names don't
mean shit. Anyway, moving right along,
what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?

ESMARELDA
I want to know what it feels like to
kill a man –

BUTCH
– I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know
he was dead 'til you told me he was
dead. Now I know he's dead, do you
wanna know how I feel about it?

Esmarelda nods her head: "yes."

BUTCH
I don't feel the least little bit
bad.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING) – NIGHT

We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.

BUTCH
(into phone)
What'd I tell ya, soon as the word
got out a fix was in, the odds would
be outta control. Hey, if he was a
better fighter he's be alive. If he
never laced up his gloves in the
first place, which he never shoulda
done, he'd be alive. Enough about
the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's
talk about the rich and prosperous
Mr. Butch. How many bookies you
spread it around with?

(PAUSE)
Eight? How long to collect?
(pause)
So by tomorrow evening, you'll have
it all?
(pause)
Good news Scotty, real good news – I
understand a few stragglers aside.
Me an' Fabienne're gonna leave in
the morning. It should take us a
couple days to get into Knoxville.
Next time we see each other, it'll
be on Tennessee time.

Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to
take him wherever he wants to go.

BUTCH
(to himself in French
with English subtitles)
Fabienne my love, our adventure
begins.

CUT TO:

EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) – NIGHT

Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain
has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out,
now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic
jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.

ESMARELDA
Forty-five sixty.

Handing her the money.

BUTCH
Merci beaucoup. And here's a little
something for the effort.

Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.

Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds
it out of reach.

BUTCH
Now if anybody should ask you about
who your fare was tonight, what're
you gonna tell 'em?

ESMARELDA
The truth. Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted, Mexicans.

He gives her the bill.

BUTCH
Bon soir, Esmarelda.

ESMARELDA
(in Spanish)
Sleep well, Butch.

He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away.
She drives off.

INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT

Butch enters and turns on the light.

Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to
us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.

FABIENNE
Keep the light off.

Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.

BUTCH
Is that better, sugar pop?

FABIENNE
Oui. Hard day at the office?

BUTCH
Pretty hard. I got into a fight.

FABIENNE
Poor baby. Can we make spoons?

Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.

When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in
babytalk.

FABIENNE
I was looking at myself in the mirror.

BUTCH
Uh-huh?

FABIENNE
I wish I had a pot.

BUTCH
You were lookin' in the mirror and
you wish you had some pot?

FABIENNE
A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are
sexy.

BUTCH
Well you should be happy, 'cause you
do.

FABIENNE
Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot!
I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna
when she did "Lucky Star," it's not
the same thing.

BUTCH
I didn't realize there was a
difference between a tummy and a pot
belly.

FABIENNE
The difference is huge.

BUTCH
You want me to have a pot?

FABIENNE
No. Pot bellies make a man look either
oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a
woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The
rest of you is normal. Normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal
ass, but with a big, perfectly round
pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a
tee-shirt two sizes too small to
accentuate it.

BUTCH
You think guys would find that
attractive?

FABIENNE
I don't give a damn what men find
attractive. It's unfortunate what we
find pleasing to the touch and
pleasing to the eye is seldom the
same.

BUTCH
If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in
it.

FABIENNE
You'd punch me in my belly?

BUTCH
Right in the belly.

FABIENNE
I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your
right on your face 'til you couldn't
breathe.

BUTCH
You'd do that to me?

FABIENNE
Yes!

BUTCH
Did you get everything, sugar pop?

FABIENNE
Yes, I did.

BUTCH
Good job.

FABIENNE
Did everything go as planned?

BUTCH
You didn't listen to the radio?

FABIENNE
I never listen to your fights. Were
you the winner?

BUTCH
I won alright.

FABIENNE
Are you still retiring?

BUTCH
Sure am.

FABIENNE
What about the man you fought?

BUTCH
Floyd retired too.

FABIENNE
(smiling)
Really?! He won't be fighting no
more?!

BUTCH
Not no more.

FABIENNE
So it all worked out in the finish?

BUTCH
We ain't at the finish, baby.

Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.

FABIENNE
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

Butch nods his head: "yes."

FABIENNE
If they find us, they'll kill us,
won't they?

Butch nods his head: "yes."

FABIENNE
But they won't find us, will they?

Butch nods his head: "no."

FABIENNE
Do you still want me to go with you?

Butch nods his head: "yes."

FABIENNE
I don't want to be a burden or a
nuisance -

Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her
crotch.

Fabienne reacts.

FABIENNE
Say it!

BUTCH
Fabienne, I want you to be with me.

FABIENNE
Forever?

BUTCH
...and ever.

Fabienne lies her head back.

Butch continues to massage her crotch.

FABIENNE
Do you love me?

BUTCH
Oui.

FABIENNE
Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?

Butch kisses her on the mouth.

BUTCH
Will you kiss it?

She nods her head: "yes."

FABIENNE
But you first.

Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral
pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.

FABIENNE
(in French, with
English subtitles)
Butch my love, the adventure begins.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

MOTEL ROOM

Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in
the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We
see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow
her up.

She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower
washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the
smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom.
Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his
head out.

BUTCH
I think I cracked a rib.

FABIENNE
Giving me oral pleasure?

BUTCH
No retard, from the fight.

FABIENNE
Don't call me retard.

BUTCH
(in a Mongoloid voice)
My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!

FABIENNE
Shut up fuck head! I hate that
Mongoloid voice.

BUTCH
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it
back! Can I have a towel please,
Miss Beautiful Tulip.

FABIENNE
Oh I like that, I like being called
a tulip. Tulip is much better than
Mongoloid.

She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban
on her head.

BUTCH
I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I
called you a retard, but I took it
back.

She hands him a towel.

BUTCH
Merci beaucoup.

FABIENNE
Butch?

BUTCH
(drying his head)
Yes, lemon pie.

FABIENNE
Where are we going to go?

BUTCH
I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want.
We're gonna get a lot of money from
this. But it ain't gonna be so much,
we can live like hogs in the fat
house forever. I was thinking we
could go somewhere in the South
Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll
carry us a long way down there.

FABIENNE
So if we wanted, we could live in
Bora Bora?

BUTCH
You betcha. And if after awhile you
don't dig Bora Bora, then we can
move over to Tahiti or Mexico.

FABIENNE
But I do not speak Spanish.

BUTCH
You don't speak Bora Boran either.
Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta
el zapataria?

FABIENNE
What does that mean?

BUTCH
Where's the shoe store?

FABIENNE
Donde esta el zapataria?

BUTCH
Excellent pronunciation. You'll be
my little mama ceta in no time.

Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes
her teeth.

Butch keeps on from the other room.

BUTCH (O.S.)
Que hora es?

FABIENNE
Que hora es?

BUTCH (O.S.)
What time is it?

FABIENNE
What time is it?

BUTCH (O.S.)
Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.

Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or
two, then she remember something.

FABIENNE
Butch.

She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only
to find him sound asleep in bed.

She looks at him for a moment.

FABIENNE
Forget it.

She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the
WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

MOTEL ROOM – MORNING

SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still
asleep in bed.

Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the
bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still
wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.

ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking
on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS".

Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing
him.

His start startles Fabienne.

FABIENNE
Merde! You startled me. Did you have
a bad dream?

Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to
focus.

Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV
Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.

BUTCH
What are you watching?

FABIENNE
A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the
name.

BUTCH
Are you watchin' it?

Fabienne enters the room.

FABIENNE
In a way. Why? Would you like for me
to switch it off?

BUTCH
Would you please?

She reaches over and turns off the TV.

BUTCH
It's a little too early in the morning
for explosions and war.

FABIENNE
What was it about?

BUTCH
How should I know, you were the one
watchin' it.

Fabienne laughs.

FABIENNE
No, imbecile, what was your dream
about?

BUTCH
Oh, I... don't remember. It's really
rare I remember a dream.

FABIENNE
You just woke up from it.

BUTCH
Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I
don't remember.

FABIENNE
Well, let's look at the grumpy man
in the morning. I didn't say you
were lying, it's just odd you don't
remember your dreams. I always
remember mine. Did you know you talk
in your sleep?

BUTCH
I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk
in my sleep?

FABIENNE
You did last night.

BUTCH
What did I say?

Laying on top of him.

FABIENNE
I don't know. I couldn't understand
you.

She kisses Butch.

FABIENNE
Why don't you get up and we'll get
some breakfast at that breakfast
place with the pancakes.

BUTCH
One more kiss and I'll get up.

Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.

FABIENNE
Satisfied?

BUTCH
Yep.

FABIENNE
Then get up, lazy bones.

Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of
the suitcase that Fabienne brought.

BUTCH
What time is it?

FABIENNE
Almost nine in the morning. What
time does our train arrive?

BUTCH
Eleven.

FABIENNE
I'm gonna order a big plate of
blueberry pancakes with maple syrup,
eggs over easy, and five sausages.

BUTCH
(surprised at her
potential appetite)
Anything to drink with that?

Butch is finished dressing.

FABIENNE
(referring to his
clothes)
Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a
tall glass or orange juice and a
black cup of coffee. After that, I'm
going to have a slice of pie.

As he goes through the suitcase.

BUTCH
Pie for breakfast?

FABIENNE
Any time of the day is a good time
for pie. Blueberry pie to go with
the pancakes. And on top, a thin
slice of melted cheese –

BUTCH
– where's my watch?

FABIENNE
It's there.

BUTCH
No, it's not. It's not here.

FABIENNE
Have you looked?

By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.

BUTCH
Yes I've fuckin' looked!!

He's now throwing clothes.

BUTCH
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?!
Are you sure you got it?

Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.

FABIENNE
Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer
–

BUTCH
– on the little kangaroo.

FABIENNE
Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.

BUTCH
Well it's not here!

FABIENNE
(on the verge of tears)
Well it should be!

BUTCH
Oh it most definitely should be here,
but it's not. So where is it?

Fabienne is crying and scared.

Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more
menacing.

BUTCH
Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin'
watch. You know what my father went
through to git me that watch?... I
don't wanna get into it right now...
but he went through a lot. Now all
this other shit, you coulda set on
fire, but I specifically reminded
you not to forget my father's watch.
Now think, did you get it?

FABIENNE
I believe so...

BUTCH
You believe so? You either did, or
you didn't, now which one is it?

FABIENNE
Then I did.

BUTCH
Are you sure?

FABIENNE
(shaking)
No.

Butch freaks out, he punches the air.

Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the
motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.

Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.

Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.

BUTCH
(to Fabienne)
No! It's not your fault.
(he approached her)
You left it at the apartment.

He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.

He touches her hand, she flinches.

BUTCH
If you did leave it at the apartment,
it's not your fault. I had you bring
a bunch of stuff. I reminded you
about it, but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me. If
all I gave a fuck about was my watch,
I should've told you. You ain't a
mind reader.

He kisses her hand. Then rises.

Fabienne is still sniffling.

Butch goes to the closet.

FABIENNE
I'm sorry.

Butch puts on his high school jacket.

BUTCH
Don't be. It just means I won't be
able to eat breakfast with you.

FABIENNE
Why does it mean that?

BUTCH
Because I'm going back to my apartment
to get my watch.

FABIENNE
Won't the gangsters be looking for
you there?

BUTCH
That's what I'm gonna find out. If
they are, and I don't think I can
handle it, I'll split.

Rising from the floor.

FABIENNE
I was so dreadful. I saw your watch,
I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.

BUTCH
Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing
you could ever do would make me
permanently angry at you.
(pause)
I love you, remember?
(he digs some money
out of his wallet)
Now here's some money, order those
pancakes and have a great breakfast.

FABIENNE
Don't go.

BUTCH
I'll be back before you can say,
blueberry pie.

FABIENNE
Blueberry pie.

BUTCH
Well maybe not that fast, but fast.
Okay? Okay?

FABIENNE
Okay.

He kisses her once more and heads for the door.

BUTCH
Bye-bye, sugar pop.

FABIENNE
Bye.

BUTCH
I'm gonna take your Honda.

FABIENNE
Okay.

And with that, he's out the door.

Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.

INT. HONDA (MOVING) – DAY

Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his
fists as he drives down the street.

BUTCH
Of all the fuckin' things she coulda
forgot, she forgets my father's watch.
I specifically reminded her not to
forget it. "Bedside table – on the
kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't
forget my father's watch."

EXT. CITY STREET – DAY

The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is
little engine will take it.

CUT TO:

A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the
arrow pointing at one hour.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER – DAY

Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a
couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before
he goes boppin' through the front door.

EXT. ALLEY – DAY

Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street,
then he discreetly glances out.

EXT. STREET – BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY

Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of
cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of
place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.
Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of
Butch's home.

Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.

Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He
crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.

Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a
combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign
sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a
graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.

EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY

Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment
building. Once again, everything appears normal – the laundry
room, the pool, his apartment door – nothing appears
disturbed.

Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12.
He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.

Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening
it.

INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY

His apartment hasn't been touched.

He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick
look around. Obviously, no one is there.

Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the
refrigerator.

He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.

With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he
goes to the bedroom.

His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment – neat, clean
and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a
few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue
of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of
Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.

Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On
the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.

He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He
opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting
down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and
puts them in the toaster.

Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.

What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun
with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.

BUTCH
(softly)
Holy shit.

He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines
it.

Then... a toilet FLUSHES.

Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to
the kitchen. There is someone behind it.

Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not
knowing what to do.

The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the
bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book
"MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.

Vincent and Butch lock eyes.

Vincent freezes.

Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's
direction.

Neither man opens his mouth.

Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.

That's all the situation needed.

Butch's finger HITS the trigger.

MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.

Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets
SIMULTANEOUSLY – LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him
through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door
at the end of the bathroom.

By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent
is annihilated.

Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look
goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once
Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.

With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61
back on the kitchen counter.

Then he exits the apartment, quickly.

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY

Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the
courtyard...

...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...

...goes through the alley...

...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.

EXT. HONDA – DAY

Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide
smile of a survivor breaks across his face.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET – DAY

The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his
apartment building.

INT. HONDA – DAY

Butch looks out the window at his former home.

BUTCH
That's how you're gonna beat 'em,
Butch. They keep underestimatin'
ya.

This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips
a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he
SINGS along with it.

He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on
the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.

Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we
see:

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut,
carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam
cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street
in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see
Marsellus clearly.

Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front
of him.

When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances
to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!

DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"

Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question.
He STOMPS on the gas pedal.

The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts
and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.

Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold
Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending
it up on the sidewalk.

Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what
at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his
nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play.
A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.

PEDESTRIAN
Jesus, are you okay?

Butch look at him, spaced-out.

BUTCH
I guess.

Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS
gather around the body.

GAWKER #1
(to the others)
He's dead! He's dead!

This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.

TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.

The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.

GAWKER #2
If you need a witness in court, I'll
be glad to help. He was a drunken
maniac. He hit you and crashed into
that car.

MARSELLUS
(still incoherent)
Who?

GAWKER #2
(pointing at Butch)
Him.

Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge
down the street, looking a shambles.

MARSELLUS
Well, I'll be damned.

The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back
away.

Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.

Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward
him.

BUTCH
Sacre bleu.

Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt,
shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.

He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground,
screaming.

LOOKY-LOO WOMAN
Oh my God, I've been shot!

That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.

Marsellus RUNS after him.

The CROWD looks agape.

Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.

The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.

Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a
sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP".

INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY

MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter
of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of
Butch RACES into his world.

MAYNARD
Can I help you wit' somethin'?

BUTCH
Shut up!

Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands
next to the door.

MAYNARD
Now you just wait one goddamn minute
–

Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in.
He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist
in Marsellus' face.

The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man
FALLS FLAT on his back.

Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.

Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in
the face.

Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold
of his middle finger.

BUTCH
So you like chasing people, huh?

He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound. Butch
then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS
back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to
shield the splatter.

BUTCH
Well guess what, big man, you caught
me –

MAYNARD (O.S.)
– hold it right there, godammit!

Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a
pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.

BUTCH
Look mister, this ain't any of your
business –

MAYNARD
– I'm makin' it my business! Now
toss that gun!

Butch does.

MAYNARD
Now you on top, stand up and come to
the counter.

Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he
gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face
with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.

After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on
the counter and moves to the telephone.

Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily
watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on
the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.

MAYNARD
Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just
caught a coupl'a flies.

Marsellus passes out.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY

TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are
two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and
a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are
unconscious.

Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both
guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two
prisoners look up at their captors.

Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one
hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in
his belt.

MAYNARD
Nobody kills anybody in my place of
business except me or Zed.

A BUZZER buzzes.

MAYNARD
That's Zed.

Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs
that lead to red curtains and goes through them.

WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed
inside the store.

Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of
the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking
in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other,
all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both
share at what they've gotten themselves into.

Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even
more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible.
The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is
a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and
stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a
long time, then says:

ZED
(to Maynard)
You said you waited for me?

MAYNARD
I did.

ZED
Then how come they're all beat up?

MAYNARD
They did that to each other. They
was fightin' when they came in. This
one was gonna shoot that one.

ZED
(to Butch)
You were gonna shoot him?

Butch makes no reply.

ZED
Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front
of this place?

MAYNARD
Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?

ZED
No, it's Thursday.

MAYNARD
Then she'll be fine.

ZED
Bring out The Gimp.

MAYNARD
I think The Gimp's sleepin'.

ZED
Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em
up then, won't you?

Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.

MAYNARD
(yelling in the hole)
Wake up!

Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a
leash.

He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises
THE GIMP.

The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black
leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs
here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather
mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth.
They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large
dog.

Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners,
then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed,
then backs away.

MAYNARD
(to The Gimp)
Down!

The Gimp gets on its knees.

Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.

MAYNARD
Who's first?

ZED
I ain't fer sure yet.

Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany,
miney, moe... " just his mouth mouthing the words and his
finger going back and forth between the two.

Butch are Marsellus are terrified.

Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.

The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.

Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving
left to right, then it stops.

TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on
Marsellus.

Zed stands up.

ZED
Wanna do it here?

MAYNARD
Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old
room.

Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old
room.

Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the
misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop.
Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and
Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the
back room, is empty.

As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before
he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.

MAYNARD
(to The Gimp)
Up!

The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on
the ceiling.

MAYNARD
Keep an eye on this one.

The Gimp bows its head: "yes." Maynard disappears into
Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because
suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.

Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath
the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history
of comedy.

From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:

MAYNARD (O.S.)
Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight
in 'em!

We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.

ZED (O.S.)
You wanna fight? You wanna fight?
Good, I like to fight!

Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic,
hurriedly struggles to get free.

The Gimp is laughing wildly.

The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.

The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:

MAYNARD (O.S.)
That's it... that's it boy, you're
goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like
that... that's good.
(grunting faster)
Stay still... stay still goddamn ya!
Zed goddammit, git over here and
hold 'em!

Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite
easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it
were never connected by a bolt.

The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.

THE GIMP
Huhng?

The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook.
He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles
and grunts.

Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S
PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making
him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash
attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then
silently makes his way through the red curtains.

INT. PAWNSHOP – DAY

Butch sneaks to the door.

On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected
to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he
stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their
way with Marsellus.

Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in
a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the
pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in
with.

He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards
it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks
about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large
Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots
what he's been looking for:

A Samurai sword.

It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the
wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign.
Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its
sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten
in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his
thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not
on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems
made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the
sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears
through the red curtains to take care of business.

INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY

Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.

Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind
the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.

INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM – DAY

Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It
swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched
positions.

Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden
horse.

Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.

Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up
behind him with the sword.

Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus,
red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see
Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.

BUTCH
Hey hillbilly.

Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.

Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across
the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on
Zed.

Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.

Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword
behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing
the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.

Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go
from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic,
which lies within reach.

Butch's eyes follow Zed's.

BUTCH
You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.

Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.

Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.

Zed studies Butch.

Butch looks hard at Zed.

Then a VOICE says:

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Step aside, Butch.

Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him,
holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.

KABOOM!!!!

Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.

Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the
used shotgun shell.

Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:

BUTCH
You okay?

MARSELLUS
Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from
okay!

Long pause.

BUTCH
What now?

MARSELLUS
What now? Well let me tell you what
now. I'm gonna call a couple pipe-
hittin' niggers, who'll go to work
on homes here with a pair of pliers
and a blow torch.
(to Zed)
Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I
ain't through with you by a damn
sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on
your ass.

BUTCH
I meant what now, between me and
you?

MARSELLUS
Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell
ya what now between me an' you. There
is no me an' you. Not no more.

BUTCH
So we're cool?

MARSELLUS
Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I
ask – two things I ask: Don't tell
nobody about this. This shit's between
me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-
the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-
agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It
ain't nobody else's business. Two:
leave town. Tonight. Right now. And
when you're gone, stay gone. You've
lost your Los Angeles privileges.
Deal?

BUTCH
Deal.

The two men shake hands, then hug one another.

MARSELLUS
Go on now, get your ass outta here.

Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.

Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.

MARSELLUS
(into the phone)
Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta
bit of a situation.

EXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY

Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He
looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment,
Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has
the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys
with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES
to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit.
Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.

WE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...

INT. BUTCH AND FABIENNE'S HOTEL ROOM – DAY

Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a "Frankie says,
Relax" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a
BOOM BOX.

EXT. CITY STREET – CHOPPER (MOVING) – DAY

Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named "GRACE."
He checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.

The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.

EXT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the
motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.

FABIENNE (O.S.)
Butch, I was so worried!

BUTCH
Honey, grab your radio and your purse
and let's go!

FABIENNE (O.S.)
But what about all our bags?

BUTCH
Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train
if we don't split now.

FABIENNE (O.S.)
Is everything well? Are we in danger?

BUTCH
We're cool. In fact, we're super-
cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait
for you outside.

Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the
motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she
sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.

FABIENNE
Where did you get this motorcycle?

BUTCH
(he kick-starts it)
It's a chopper, baby, hop on.

Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.

FABIENNE
What happened to my Honda?

BUTCH
Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.

FABIENNE
You're hurt?

BUTCH
I might've broke my nose, no biggie.
Hop on.

She doesn't move.

Butch looks at her.

BUTCH
Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!

Fabienne starts to cry.

Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the
bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her
hand.

BUTCH
I'm sorry, baby-love.

FABIENNE
(crying)
You were gone so long, I started to
think dreadful thoughts.

BUTCH
I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.
Everything's fine. Hey, how was
breakfast?

FABIENNE
(waterworks drying a
little)
It was good –

BUTCH
– did you get the blueberry pancakes?

FABIENNE
No, they didn't have blueberry
pancakes, I had to get buttermilk –
are you sure you're okay?

BUTCH
Baby-love, from the moment I left
you, this has been without a doubt
the single weirdest day of my entire
life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about
it.

Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up.

FABIENNE
Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

BUTCH
It's a chopper.

FABIENNE
Whose chopper is this?

BUTCH
Zed's.

FABIENNE
Who's Zed?

BUTCH
Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.

And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the
SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE CARD:

"JULES VINCENT JIMMIE & THE WOLF"

TITLE DISAPPEARS.

Over black, we can HEAR in the distance, men talking.

JULES (O.S.)
You ever read the Bible, Brett?

BRETT (O.S.)
Yes!

JULES (O.S.)
There's a passage I got memorized,
seems appropriate for this situation:
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men..."

FADE UP:

INT. BATHROOM – DAY

We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in
earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except
this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The
Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard
to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly
CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.

JULES (O.S.)
"...blessed is he who, in the name
of charity and good will, shepherded
the weak through the valley of
darkness. And I will strike down
upon thee with great vengeance and
furious anger those who attempt to
poison and destroy my brothers. And
you will know I am the Lord when I
lay my vengeance upon you."

BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!

The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the
back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow
fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough
to stick their head through that door.

Then he listens to them talk.

VINCENT (O.S.)
Friend of yours?

JULES (O.S.)
Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.

Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the
door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around
is the way to go.

INT. APARTMENT – DAY

The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES
out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his
hand cannon.

FOURTH MAN
Die... die... die... die...!

DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.

He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion
crosses his face.

TWO SHOT – JULES AND VINCENT

Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems,
none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody.
Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit?" They're
as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other,
they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.

FOURTH MAN
I don't understand –

The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's
bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.

The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits
down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs
it off.

Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.

VINCENT
Why the fuck didn't you tell us about
that guy in the bathroom? Slip your
mind? Forget he was in there with a
goddamn hand cannon?

JULES
(to himself)
We should be fuckin' dead right now.
(pause)
Did you see that gun he fired at us?
It was bigger than him.

VINCENT
.357.

JULES
We should be fuckin' dead!

VINCENT
Yeah, we were lucky.

Jules rises, moving toward Vincent.

JULES
That shit wasn't luck. That shit was
somethin' else.

Vincent prepares to leave.

VINCENT
Yeah, maybe.

JULES
That was... divine intervention. You
know what divine intervention is?

VINCENT
Yeah, I think so. That means God
came down from Heaven and stopped
the bullets.

JULES
Yeah, man, that's what is means.
That's exactly what it means! God
came down from Heaven and stopped
the bullets.

VINCENT
I think we should be going now.

JULES
Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do
that! Don't blow this shit off!
What just happened was a fuckin'
miracle!

VINCENT
Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit
happens.

JULES
Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just
happen.

VINCENT
Do you wanna continue this theological
discussion in the car, or at the
jailhouse with the cops?

JULES
We should be fuckin' dead now, my
friend! We just witnessed a miracle,
and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge
it!

VINCENT
Okay man, it was a miracle, can we
leave now?

EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING – MORNING

The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic.

INT. NOVA (MOVING) – MORNING

Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and
Marvin in the back.

VINCENT
...Ever seen that show "COPS?" I
was watchin' it once and this cop
was on it who was talkin' about this
time he got into this gun fight with
a guy in a hallway. He unloads on
this guy and he doesn't hit anything.
And these guys were in a hallway.
It's a freak, but it happens.

JULES
If you wanna play blind man, then go
walk with a Shepherd. But me, my
eyes are wide fuckin' open.

VINCENT
What the fuck does that mean?

JULES
That's it for me. For here on in,
you can consider my ass retired.

VINCENT
Jesus Christ!

JULES
Don't blaspheme!

VINCENT
Goddammit, Jules –

JULES
– I said don't do that –

VINCENT
– you're fuckin' freakin' out!

JULES
I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm
through.

VINCENT
While you're at it, be sure to tell
'im why.

JULES
Don't worry, I will.

VINCENT
I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he
laughs his ass off.

JULES
I don't give a damn if he does.

Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his
grip.

VINCENT
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

MARVIN
I don't even have an opinion.

VINCENT
C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came
down from Heaven and stopped the
bullets?

Vincent's .45 goes BANG!

Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES
blood and SHAKES.

JULES
What the fuck's happening?

VINCENT
I just accidentally shot Marvin in
the throat.

JULES
Why the fuck did you do that?

VINCENT
I didn't mean to do it. I said it
was an accident.

JULES
I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in
my time –

VINCENT
– chill out, man, it was an accident,
okay? You hit a bump or somethin'
and the gun went off.

JULES
The car didn't hit no motherfuckin'
bump!

VINCENT
Look! I didn't mean to shoot this
son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went
off, don't ask me how!

JULES
Look at this mess! We're drivin'
around on a city street in broad
daylight –

VINCENT
– I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin'
about the splatter.

JULES
Well you better be thinkin' about it
now, motherfucker! We gotta get this
car off the road. Cops tend to notice
shit like you're driving a car
drenched in fuckin' blood.

VINCENT
Can't we just take it to a friendly
place?

JULES
This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus
don't got no friendly places in the
Valley.

VINCENT
Well, don't look at me, this is your
town, Jules.

Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits.

VINCENT
Who ya callin'?

JULES
A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.

VINCENT
Where's Toluca Lake.

JULES
On the other side of the hill, by
Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass
ain't home, I don't know what the
fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any
other partners in 818.
(into phone)
Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules.
(pause)
Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are
in some serious shit. We're in a car
we gotta get off the road, pronto! I
need to use your garage for a couple
hours.

INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM – DAY

Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while
Vincent stands behind him.

JULES
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie's situation. He's
one remark away from kickin' our
asses out the door.

VINCENT
If he kicks us out, whadda we do?

JULES
Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made
a couple phone calls. But I never
want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's
my friend and you don't bust in your
friend's house and start tellin' 'im
what's what.

Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at
the sink.

VINCENT
Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He
kinda freaked out back there when he
saw Marvin.

JULES
Put yourself in his position. It's
eight o'clock in the morning. He
just woke up, he wasn't prepared for
this shit. Don't forget who's doin'
who a favor.

Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.

VINCENT
If the price of that favor is I gotta
take shit, he can stick his favor
straight up his ass.

When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is
stained with red.

JULES
What the fuck did you just do to his
towel?

VINCENT
I was just dryin' my hands.

JULES
You're supposed to wash 'em first.

VINCENT
You watched me wash 'em.

JULES
I watched you get 'em wet.

VINCENT
I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to
get off. Maybe if he had some Lava,
I coulda done a better job.

JULES
I used the same soap you did and
when I dried my hands, the towel
didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie
pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who
cares? But it's shit like this that's
gonna bring this situation to a boil.
If he were to come in here and see
that towel like that... I'm tellin'
you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause
if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie
on account of you... Look, I ain't
threatenin' you, I respect you an'
all, just don't put me in that
position.

JULES
Jules, you ask me nice like that, no
problem. He's your friend, you handle
him.

INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN – MORNING

Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug
of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in
his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe.

JULES
Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious
gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda
been satisfied with freeze-dried
Tasters Choice. You spring this
gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What
flavor is this?

JIMMIE
Knock it off, Julie.

JULES
What?

JIMMIE
I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can
stop butterin' me up. I don't need
you to tell me how good my coffee
is. I'm the one who buys it, I know
how fuckin' good it is. When Bonnie
goes shoppin;, she buys shit. I buy
the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
But what's on my mind at this moment
isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's
the dead nigger in my garage.

JULES
Jimmie –

JIMMIE
– I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a
question, Jules. When you drove in
here, did you notice a sign out front
that said, "Dead nigger storage?"

Jules starts to "Jimmie" him –

JIMMIE
– answer to question. Did you see a
sign out in front of my house that
said, "Dead nigger storage?"

JULES
(playing along)
Naw man, I didn't.

JIMMIE
You know why you didn't see that
sign?

JULES
Why?

JIMMIE
'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my
fuckin' business!

Jules starts to "Jimmie" him.

JIMMIE
– I ain't through! Now don't you
understand that if Bonnie comes home
and finds a dead body in her house,
I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage
counselor, no trial separation –
fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced. The last time
me an' Bonnie talked about this shit
was gonna be the last time me an'
Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I
wanna help ya out Julie, I really
do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife
doin' it.

JULES
Jimmie –

JIMMIE
– don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I
can't be Jimmied. There's nothin'
you can say that's gonna make me
forget I love my wife. Now she's
workin' the graveyard shift at the
hospital. She'll be comin' home in
less than an hour and a half. Make
your phone calls, talk to your people,
than get the fuck out of my house.

JULES
That's all we want. We don't wanna
fuck up your shit. We just need to
call our people to bring us in.

JIMMIE
Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's
in my bedroom.

INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S DINING ROOM – MORNING

Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy
robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.

MARSELLUS
...well, say she comes home. Whaddya
think she'll do?
(pause)
No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That
ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er,
I don't. How bad, a lot or a little?

INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING

Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.

JULES
You got to appreciate what an
explosive element this Bonnie
situation is. If she comes home from
a hard day's work and finds a bunch
of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta'
shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin'
what she's apt to do.

MARSELLUS
I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm
doin' is contemplating the "ifs."

JULES
I don't wanna hear about no
motherfuckin' "ifs."What I wanna
hear from your ass is: "you ain't
got no problems, Jules. I'm on the
motherfucker. Go back in there, chill
them niggers out and wait for the
cavalry, which should be comin'
directly."

MARSELLUS
You ain't got no problems, Jules.
I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in
there, chill them niggers out and
wait for The Wolf, who should be
comin' directly.

JULES
You sendin' The Wolf?

MARSELLUS
Feel better?

JULES
Shit Negro, that's all you had to
say.

INT. HOTEL SUITE – MORNING

The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite
into the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a
fancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in
fancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing:
Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the
tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka "THE WOLF". We also see The
Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in.

THE WOLF
(into phone)
Is she the hysterical type?
(pause)
When she due?
(jotting down)
Give me the principals' names again?
(jots down)
Jules...

We SEE his book. The page has written on it:

"1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head)
Bloody shot-up car Jules (black)"

THE WOLF
...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...

HE WRITES:

"Vincent (Dean Martin) Jimmie (house) Bonnie (9:30)"

THE WOLF
Expect a call around 10:30. It's
about thirty minutes away. I'll be
there in ten.

He hangs up. We never see his face.

CUT TO:

TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:

"NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER"

CUT TO:

EXT. JIMMIE'S STREET – MORNING

A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home,
in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a
dime in front of Jimmie's house.

A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.

INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE – MORNING

Jimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the
tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at
Jimmie.

THE WOLF
You're Jimmie, right? This is your
house?

JIMMIE
Yeah.

THE WOLF
(stick his hand out)
I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.

JIMMIE
Good, 'cause we got one.

THE WOLF
So I heard. May I come in?

JIMMIE
Please do.

In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.

THE WOLF
You must be Jules, which would make
you Vincent. Let's get down to brass
tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed
correctly, the clock is ticking, is
that right, Jimmie?

JIMMIE
100%.

THE WOLF
Your wife, Bonnie...
(refers to his pad)
...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is
that correct?

JIMMIE
Uh-huh.

THE WOLF
I was led to believe if she comes
home and finds us here, she wouldn't
appreciate it none too much.

JIMMIE
She won't at that.

THE WOLF
That gives us forty minutes to get
the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you
do what I say when I say it, should
by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a
car, minus a head, in a garage. Take
me to it.

INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING

The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He
studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside,
circling it.

THE WOLF
Jimmie?

JIMMIE
Yes.

THE WOLF
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee in there. Would
you make me a cup?

JIMMIE
Sure, how do you take it?

THE WOLF
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.

THE WOLF
About the car, is there anything I
need to know? Does it stall, does it
make a lot of noise, does it smoke,
is there gas in it, anything?

JULES
Aside from how it looks, the car's
cool.

THE WOLF
Positive? Don't get me out on the
road and I find out the brake lights
don't work.

JULES
Hey man, as far as I know, the
motherfucker's tip-top.

THE WOLF
Good enough, let's go back to the
kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN – MORNING

Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.

THE WOLF
Thank you, Jimmie.

He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the
three men the plan of action.

THE WOLF
Okay first thing, you two.
(meaning Jules and
Vincent)
Take the body, stick it in the trunk.
Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty
domesticated house. That would lead
me to believe that in the garage or
under the sink, you got a bunch of
cleansers and cleaners and shit like
that, am I correct?

JIMMIE
Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.

THE WOLF
Good. What I need you two fellas to
do is take those cleaning products
and clean the inside of the car. And
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You
need to go in the backseat, scoop up
all those little pieces of brain and
skull. Get it out of there. Wipe
down the upholstery – now when it
comes to upholstery, it don't need
to be spic and span, you don't need
to eat off it. Give it a good once
over. What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts. The pools
of blood that have collected, you
gotta soak that shit up. But the
windows are a different story. Them
you really clean. Get the Windex, do
a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to
raid your linen closet. I need
blankets, I need comforters, I need
quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker
the better, the darker the better.
No whites, can't use 'em. We need to
camouflage the interior of the car.
We're gonna line the front seat and
the backseat and the floor boards
with quilts and blankets. If a cop
stops us and starts stickin' his big
snout in the car, the subterfuge
won't last. But at a glance, the car
will appear to be normal. Jimmie –
lead the way, boys – get to work.

The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving
Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.

VINCENT
(calling after him)
A "please" would be nice.

The Wolf stops and turns around.

THE WOLF
Come again?

VINCENT
I said a "please" would be nice.

The Wolf takes a step toward him.

THE WOLF
Set is straight, Buster. I'm not
here to say "please."I'm here to
tell you want to do. And if self-
preservation is an instinct you
possess, you better fuckin' do it
and do it quick. I'm here to help.
If my help's not appreciated, lotsa
luck gentlemen.

JULES
It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your
help is definitely appreciated.

VINCENT
I don't mean any disrespect. I just
don't like people barkin' orders at
me.

THE WOLF
If I'm curt with you, it's because
time is a factor. I think fast, I
talk fast, and I need you guys to
act fast if you want to get out of
this. So pretty please, with sugar
on top, clean the fuckin' car.

INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING

Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he
has.

The Wolf is on the phone.

THE WOLF
(into phone)
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
(pause)
White.
(pause)
Nothin', except for the mess inside.
(pause)
About twenty minutes.
(pause)
Nobody who'll be missed.
(pause)
You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.
(he looks at Jimmie)
How we comin', Jimmie?

Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen.

JIMMIE
Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand
somethin' –

THE WOLF
– Winston, Jimmie – please, Winston.

JIMMIE
You gotta understand something,
Winston. I want to help you guys out
and all, but that's my best linen.
It was a wedding present from my
Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and
they ain't with us anymore –

THE WOLF
– let me ask you a question, if you
don't mind?

JIMMIE
Sure.

THE WOLF
Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny
millionaires?

JIMMIE
No.

THE WOLF
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And
I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and
Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they
would've furnished you with a whole
bedroom set, which your Uncle
Marsellus is more than happy to do.
(takes out a roll of
bills)
I like oak myself, that's what's in
my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie,
you an oak man?

JIMMIE
Oak's nice.

INT. GARAGE – MORNING

Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up.
Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is
in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs
of brain.

Both are twice as bloody as they were before.

JULES
I will never forgive your ass for
this shit. This is some fucked-up
repugnant shit!

VINCENT
Did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he's wrong,
he's immediately forgiven for all
wrong-doings?

JULES
Man, get outta my face with that
shit! The motherfucker who said that
never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces
of skull with his fingers on account
of your dumb ass.

VINCENT
I got a threshold, Jules. I got a
threshold for the abuse I'll take.
And you're crossin' it. I'm a race
car and you got me in the red. Redline
7000, that's where you are. Just
know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be
drivin' a race car when it's in the
red. It could blow.

JULES
You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a
mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!
Every time my fingers touch brain
I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS
OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker
usta talk about. In fact, what the
fuck am I doin' in the back? You're
the motherfucker should be on brain
detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin'
windows and you're pickin' up this
nigger's skull.

INT. CHEVY NOVA – MORNING

The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with
bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a
portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript
vehicle.

The Wolf circles the car examining it.

Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a
bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a
good job they've done.

THE WOLF
Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out
of this yet.

JIMMIE
I can't believe that's the same car.

THE WOLF
Well, let's not start suckin' each
other's dicks quite yet. Phase one
is complete, clean the car, which
moves us right along to phase two,
clean you two.

EXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD – MORNING

Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits,
covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic
Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one
of those guns nozzles attached.

THE WOLF
Strip.

VINCENT
All the way?

THE WOLF
To your bare ass.

As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.

THE WOLF
Quickly gentlemen, we got about
fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-
half comes pulling into the driveway.

JULES
This morning air is some chilly shit.

VINCENT
Are you sure this is absolutely
necessary?

THE WOLF
You know what you two look like?

VINCENT
What?

THE WOLF
Like a couple of guys who just blew
off somebody's head. Yes, strippin'
off those bloody rags is absolutely
necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's
garbage bag.

JULES
Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid
like puttin' that out in front of
your house for Elmo the garbage man
to take away.

THE WOLF
Don't worry, we're takin' it with
us. Jim, the soap.

He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.

THE WOLF
Okay gentlemen, you're both been to
County before, I'm sure. Here it
comes.

He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.

JULES
Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!

THE WOLF
Better you than me, gentlemen.

The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.

THE WOLF
Don't be afraid of the soap, spread
it around.

The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.

THE WOLF
Towel 'em.

Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously
across their bodies.

THE WOLF
You're dry enough, give 'em their
clothes.

FADE UP ON:

JULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They
look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses
we first met.

THE WOLF
Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've
planned this better. You guys look
like... what do they look like,
Jimmie?

JIMMIE
Dorks. They look like a couple of
dorks.

The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.

JULES
Ha ha ha. They're your clothes,
motherfucker.

JIMMIE
I guess you just gotta know how to
wear them.

JULES
Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert
on wearin' dorky shit that your is.

THE WOLF
C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and
jokin' our way into prison. Don't
make me beg.

INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING

The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin.
The Wolf SLAMS is closed.

THE WOLF
Gentlemen, let's get our rules of
the road straight. We're going to a
place called Monster Joe's Truck and
Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter
Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.
The place is North Hollywood, so a
few twist and turns aside, we'll be
goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll
drive the tainted car. Jules, you
ride with me. Vincent, you follow
in my Porsche. Now if we cross the
path of any John Q. Laws, nobody
does a fuckin' thing 'til I do
something.

(TO JULES)
What did I say?

JULES
Don't do shit unless –

THE WOLF
– unless what?

JULES
Unless you do it first.

THE WOLF
Spoken like a true prodigy.
(to Vincent)
How 'bout you, Lash Larue? Can you
keep your spurs from jingling and
jangling?

VINCENT
I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went
off, I dunno how.

THE WOLF
Fair enough.
(he throws Vince his
car keys)
I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep
up. If I get my car back any different
than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna
be disposing of two bodies.

EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW – MORNING

Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.

JULES
We cool?

WINSTON
Like it never happened.

Jules and Vincent bump fists.

WINSTON
Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all
this will be hers.

RAQUEL
(to the boys)
Hi. You know, if they ever do "I
SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys,
I'd be great. What's with the
outfits. You guys going to a
volleyball game?

Winston laughs, the boys groan.

WINSTON
I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast.
Maybe I can drop you two off. Where
do you live?

VINCENT
Redondo Beach.

JULES
Inglewood.

Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a
"DEAD ZONE" trance.

WINSTON
(painfully)
It's your future: I see... a cab
ride.
(dropping the act)
Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
(to Raquel)
Say goodbye, Raquel.

RAQUEL
Goodbye, Raquel.

WINSTON
I'll see you two around, and stay
outta trouble, you crazy kids.

Winston turns to leave.

JULES
Mr. Wolf.

He turns around.

JULES
I was a pleasure watchin' you work.

The Wolf smiles.

WINSTON
Call me Winston.

He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.

WINSTON
You hear that, young lady? Respect.
You could lean a lot from those two
fine specimens. Respect for one's
elders shows character.

RAQUEL
I have character.

WINSTON
Just because you are a character
doesn't mean you have character.

RAQUEL
Oh you're so funny, oh you're so
funny.

The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.

The two men left alone look at each other.

JULES
Wanna share a cab?

VINCENT
You know I could go for some
breakfast. Want to have breakfast
with me?

JULES
Sure.

INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a
big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto.
Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a
muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a
refill for both men,

VINCENT
Thanks a bunch.
(to Jules, who's
nursing his coffee)
Want a sausage?

JULES
Naw, I don't eat pork.

VINCENT
Are you Jewish?

JULES
I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig
on swine.

VINCENT
Why not?

JULES
They're filthy animals. I don't eat
filthy animals.

VINCENT
Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste
good.

JULES
A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin
pie. I'll never know 'cause even if
it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy
motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in
shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't
wanna eat nothin' that ain't got
enough sense to disregard its own
feces.

VINCENT
How about dogs? Dogs eat their own
feces.

JULES
I don't eat dog either.

VINCENT
Yes, but do you consider a dog to be
a filthy animal?

JULES
I wouldn't go so far as to call a
dog filthy, but they're definitely
dirty. But a dog's got personality.
And personality goes a long way.

VINCENT
So by that rationale, if a pig had a
better personality, he's cease to be
a filthy animal?

JULES
We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one
motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd
have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.

The two men laugh.

VINCENT
Good for you. Lighten up a little.
You been sittin' there all quiet.

JULES
I just been sittin' here thinkin'.

VINCENT
(mouthful of food)
About what?

JULES
The miracle we witnessed.

VINCENT
The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed
a freak occurrence.

JULES
Do you know that a miracle is?

VINCENT
An act of God.

JULES
What's an act of God?

VINCENT
I guess it's when God makes the
impossible possible. And I'm sorry
Jules, but I don't think what happened
this morning qualifies.

JULES
Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't
matter. You're judging this thing
the wrong way. It's not about what.
It could be God stopped the bullets,
he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found
my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge
shit like this based on merit. Whether
or not what we experienced was an
according-to-Hoyle miracle is
insignificant. What is significant
is I felt God's touch, God got
involved.

VINCENT
But why?

JULES
That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I
don't know why. But I can't go back
to sleep.

VINCENT
So you're serious, you're really
gonna quit?

JULES
The life, most definitely.

Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In
the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.

PATRON
Garcon! Coffee!

We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene
of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.

VINCENT
So if you're quitting the life,
what'll you do?

JULES
That's what I've been sitting here
contemplating. First, I'm gonna
deliver this case to Marsellus. Then,
basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.

VINCENT
What do you mean, walk the earth?

JULES
You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU."
Just walk from town to town, meet
people, get in adventures.

VINCENT
How long do you intend to walk the
earth?

JULES
Until God puts me where he want me
to be.

VINCENT
What if he never does?

JULES
If it takes forever, I'll wait
forever.

VINCENT
So you decided to be a bum?

JULES
I'll just be Jules, Vincent – no
more, no less.

VINCENT
No Jules, you're gonna be like those
pieces of shit out there who beg for
change. They walk around like a bunch
of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in
garbage bins, they eat what I throw
away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got
a word for 'em, they're called bums.
And without a job, residence, or
legal tender, that's what you're
gonna be – a fuckin' bum!

JULES
Look my friend, this is just where
me and you differ –

VINCENT
– what happened was peculiar – no
doubt about it – but it wasn't water
into wine.

JULES
All shapes and sizes, Vince.

VINCENT
Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!

JULES
If you find my answers frightening,
Vincent, you should cease askin'
scary questions.

VINCENT
I gotta take a shit. To be continued.

Vincent exits for the restroom.

Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin
and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.

PUMPKIN
Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!

HONEY BUNNY
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
I'll execute every one of you
motherfuckers! Got that?!

Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the
table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it
out, COCKING IT.

PUMPKIN
Customers stay seated, waitresses on
the floor.

HONEY BUNNY
Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die,
do it or fucking die!

Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While
Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them
terrified.

PUMPKIN
You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out
here! Asta luego!

Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.

PUMPKIN
On the floor or I'll cook you ass,
comprende?

They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.

MANAGER
I'm the manager here, there's no
problem, no problem at all –

Pumpkin heads his way.

PUMPKIN
You're gonna give me a problem?

He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the
Manager's neck.

PUMPKIN
What? You said you're gonna give me
a problem?

MANAGER
No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you
any problem!

PUMPKIN
I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks
like the hero type to me!

HONEY BUNNY
Don't take any chances. Execute him!

The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his
hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.

MANAGER
Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm
just a coffee shop manager. Take
anything you want.

PUMPKIN
Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll
be all over.

MANAGER
Everybody just be calm and cooperate
with them and this will be all over
soon!

PUMPKIN
Well done, now git your fuckin' ass
on the ground.

INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM – MORNING

Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside,
reads his "MODESTY BLAISE" book.

INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from
the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter
with a trash bag in his hand.

PUMPKIN
Okay people, I'm going to go 'round
and collect your wallets. Don't talk,
just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?

Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his
.45 ready to spit under the table.

Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet,
briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more
respectful, him manner more on guard.

PUMPKIN
In the bag.

Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer,
Pumpkin points to the briefcase.

PUMPKIN
What's in that?

JULES
My boss' dirty laundry.

PUMPKIN
You boss makes you do his laundry?

JULES
When he wants it clean.

PUMPKIN
Sounds like a shit job.

JULES
Funny, I've been thinkin' the same
thing.

PUMPKIN
Open it up.

Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.

JULES
'Fraid I can't do that.

Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the
gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the
hammer.

PUMPKIN
I didn't hear you.

JULES
Yes, you did.

This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard
it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.

HONEY BUNNY
What's goin' on?

PUMPKIN
Looks like we got a vigilante in our
midst.

HONEY BUNNY
Shoot 'em in the face!

JULES
I don't mean to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time I've
had gun pointed at me.

PUMPKIN
You don't open up that case, it's
gonna be the last.

MANAGER
(on the ground)
Quit causing problems, you'll get us
all killed! Give 'em what you got
and get 'em out of here.

JULES
Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat
man, this ain't any of your goddamn
business!

PUMPKIN
I'm countin' to three, and if your
hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna
unload right in your fuckin' face.
Clear? One...

PUMPKIN
...two... three.

JULES
You win.

Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.

JULES
It's all yours, Ringo.

PUMPKIN
Open it.

Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to
Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case.
Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across
the room, can't see shit.

HONEY BUNNY
What is it? What is it?

PUMPKIN
(softly)
Is that what I think it is?

Jules nods his head: "yes."

PUMPKIN
It's beautiful.

Jules nods his head: "yes."

HONEY BUNNY
Goddammit, what is it?

Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering
the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to
pick up the case.

Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of
Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand
comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45
hand under Pumpkin's chin.

Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.

HONEY BUNNY
Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow
your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya!
I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're
gonna fuckin' die bad!

JULES
(to Pumpkin)
Tell that bitch to be cool! Say,
bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!

PUMPKIN
Chill out, honey!

HONEY BUNNY
Let him go!

JULES
(softly)
Tell her it's gonna be okay.

PUMPKIN
I'm gonna be okay.

JULES
Promise her.

PUMPKIN
I promise.

JULES
Tell her to chill.

PUMPKIN
Just chill out.

JULES
What's her name?

PUMPKIN
Yolanda.

Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only
at Pumpkin.

JULES
(to Yolanda)
So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna
do anything stupid, are we?

YOLANDA
(crying)
Don't you hurt him.

JULES
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're
gonna be like three Fonzies. And
what' Fonzie like?

No answer.

JULES
C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?

YOLANDA
(through tears, unsure)
He's cool?

JULES
Correct-amundo! And that's what we're
gonna be, we're gonna be cool.
(to Pumpkin)
Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three
and I want you to let go your gun
and lay your palms flat on the table.
But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?

Pumpkin looks at him.

JULES
One... two... three.

Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.

Yolanda can't stand it anymore.

YOLANDA
Okay, now let him go!

JULES
Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be
cool. When you yell at me, it makes
me nervous. When I get nervous, I
get scared. And when motherfuckers
get scared, that's when motherfuckers
get accidentally shot.

YOLANDA
(more conversational)
Just know: you hurt him, you die.

JULES
That seems to be the situation. Now
I don't want that and you don't want
that and Ringo here don't want that.
So let's see what we can do.
(to Ringo)
Now this is the situation. Normally
both of your asses would be dead as
fuckin' fried chicken. But you
happened to pull this shit while I'm
in a transitional period. I don't
wanna kill ya, I want to help ya.
But I'm afraid I can't give you the
case. It don't belong to me. Besides,
I went through too much shit this
morning on account of this case to
just hand it over to your ass.

VINCENT (O.S.)
What the fuck's goin' on here?

Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.

Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at
Yolanda.

JULES
It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't
do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's
cool baby, nothin's changed. We're
still just talkin'.
(to Pumpkin)
Tell her we're still cool.

PUMPKIN
It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still
cool.

VINCENT
(gun raised)
What the hell's goin' on, Jules?

JULES
Nothin' I can't handle. I want you
to just hang back and don't do shit
unless it's absolutely necessary.

VINCENT
Check.

JULES
Yolanda, how we doin, baby?

YOLANDA
I gotta go pee! I want to go home.

JULES
Just hang in there, baby, you're
doing' great, Ringo's proud of you
and so am I. It's almost over.
(to Pumpkin)
Now I want you to go in that bag and
find my wallet.

PUMPKIN
Which one is it?

JULES
It's the one that says Bad
Motherfucker on it.

Pumpkin looks in the bag and – sure enough – there's a wallet
with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it.

JULES
That's my bad motherfucker. Now open
it up and take out the cash. How
much is there?

PUMPKIN
About fifteen hundred dollars.

JULES
Put it in your pocket, it's yours.
Now with the rest of them wallets
and the register, that makes this a
pretty successful little score.

VINCENT
Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen
hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on
general principle.

JULES
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing,
now hang back and shut the fuck up.
Besides, I ain't givin' it to him.
I'm buyin' somethin' for my money.
Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?

PUMPKIN
What?

JULES
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't hafta kill your ass. You
read the Bible?

PUMPKIN
Not regularly.

JULES
There's a passage I got memorized.
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of the darkness. For he
is truly his brother's keeper and
the finder of lost children. And I
will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know I am the
Lord when I lay my vengeance upon
you." I been sayin' that shit for
years. And if you ever heard it, it
meant your ass. I never really
questioned what it meant. I thought
it was just a coldblooded thing to
say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped
a cap in his ass. But I saw some
shit this mornin' made me think twice.
Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're
the evil man. And I'm the righteous
man. And Mr. .45 here, he's the
shepherd protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness. Or is
could by you're the righteous man
and I'm the shepherd and it's the
world that's evil and selfish. I'd
like that. But that shit ain't the
truth. The truth is you're the weak.
And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But
I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to
be a shepherd.

Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.

Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to
Yolanda.

She looks back.

Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the
door.

Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time,
takes a sip of coffee.

JULES
(to himself)
It's cold.

He pushes it aside.

Vincent appears next to Jules.

VINCENT
I think we oughta leave now.

JULES
That's probably a good idea.

Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the
briefcase.

Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the
Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes
– wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts,
swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics – walk out of
the coffee shop together without saying a word.

FADE OUT

THE END



1 INT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING

Eight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a
breakfast cafe. They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE,
MR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT,
and the big boss, JOE CABOT. Most are finished eating and
are enjoying coffee and conversation. Joe flips through a
small address book. Mr. Pink is telling a long and
involved story about Madonna.

MR. PINK
"Like a Virgin" is all about a
girl who digs a guy with a big
dick. The whole song is a
metaphor for big dicks.

MR. BLUE
No it's not. It's about a girl
who is very vulnerable and she's
been fucked over a few times.
Then she meets some guy who's
really sensitive--

MR. PINK
--Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay.
Tell that bullshit to the
tourists.

JOE
(looking through his
address book)
Toby...who the fuck is Toby?
Toby...Toby...think...think...
think...

MR. PINK
It's not about a nice girl who
meets a sensitive boy. Now
granted that's what "True Blue" is
about, no argument about that.

MR. ORANGE
Which one is "True Blue?"

NICE GUY EDDIE
You don't remember "True Blue?"
That was a big ass hit for
Madonna. Shit, I don't even
follow this Tops In Pops shit, and
I've at least heard of "True
Blue."

MR. ORANGE
Look, asshole, I didn't say I
ain't heard of it. All I asked
was how does it go? Excuse me
for not being the world's biggest
Madonna fan.

MR. BROWN
I hate Madonna.

MR. BLUE
I like her early stuff. You know,
"Lucky Star," "Borderline" - but
once she got into her "Papa Don't
Preach" phase, I don't know, I
tuned out.

MR. PINK
Hey, fuck all that, I'm
making a point here. You're gonna
make me lose my train
of thought.

JOE
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china
girl.

MR. WHITE
What's that?

JOE
I found this old address book in a
jacket I ain't worn in a coon's
age. Toby what? What the fuck
was her last name?

MR. PINK
Where was I?

MR. ORANGE
You said "True Blue" was about a
nice girl who finds a sensitive
fella. But "Like a Virgin" was a
metaphor for big dicks.

MR. PINK
Let me tell ya what "Like a
Virgin"'s about. It's about some
cooze who's a regular fuck
machine.
I mean all the time, morning, day,
night, afternoon, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick.

MR. BLUE
How many dicks was that?

MR. WHITE
A lot.

MR. PINK
Then one day she meets a John
Holmes motherfucker, and it's
like, whoa baby. This mother
fucker's like Charles Bronson in
"The Great Escape." He's diggin
tunnels. Now she's gettin this
serious dick action, she's feelin
something she ain't felt since
forever. Pain.

JOE
Chew? Toby Chew? No.

MR. PINK
It hurts. It hurts her. It
shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should
be Bubble-Yum by now. But when
this cat fucks her, it hurts. It
hurts like the first time. The
pain is reminding a fuck machine
what is was like to be a virgin.
Hence, "Like a Virgin."

The fellas crack up.

JOE
Wong?

MR. PINK
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What
the fuck do you know about it
anyway? You're still listening to
Jerry-fucking-Vale.

JOE
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You
know, like the Chinese name?

Mr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand. They
fight, but they're not really mad at each other.

MR. WHITE
Give me this fucking thing.

JOE
What the fuck do you think you're
doin? Give me my book back!

MR. WHITE
I'm sick of fuckin hearin it Joe,
I'll give it back when we leave.

JOE
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when
we leave, give it back now.

MR. WHITE
For the past fifteen minutes now,
you've just been droning on with
names. "Toby...Toby...Toby...
Toby Wong...Toby Wong...Toby
Chung...fuckin Charlie Chan." I
got Madonna's big dick outta my
right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-
know-what, outta my left.

JOE
What do you care?

MR. WHITE
When you're annoying as hell, I
care a lot.

JOE
Give me my book.

MR. WHITE
You gonna put it away?

JOE
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do
with it.

MR. WHITE
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to keep it.

MR. BLONDE
Joe, you want me to shoot him for
you?

MR. WHITE
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you
better wake up and apologize.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Have you guys been listening to K-
BILLY's super sounds of the
seventies weekend?

MR. PINK
Yeah, it's fuckin great isn't it?

NICE GUY EDDIE
Can you believe the songs they
been playin?

MR. PINK
No, I can't. You know what I
heard the other day? "Heartbeat -
It's Lovebeat," by little Tony
DeFranco and the DeFranco Family.
I haven't heard that since I was
in fifth fuckin grade.

NICE GUY EDDIE
When I was coming down here, I was
playin it. And "The Night the
Lights Went Out in Georgia" came
on. Now I ain't heard that song
since it was big, but when it was
big, I heard it a million-
trillion times. I'm listening to
it this morning, and this was the
first time I ever realized that
the lady singing the song, was the
one who killed Andy.

MR. BLUE
You didn't know Vicki Lawrence
killed the guy?

NICE GUY EDDIE
I thought the cheatin wife shot
Andy.

MR. BLONDE
They say it in the song.

NICE GUY EDDIE
I know, I heard it. I musta zoned
out whenever that part came on
before. I thought when she said
that little sister stuff, she was
talkin about her sister- in-law,
the cheatin wife.

JOE
No, she did it. She killed the
cheatin wife, too.

MR. PINK
You know the part in "Gypsies,
Tramps and Theives," when she says
"Poppa woulda shot his if he knew
what he'd done?" I could never
figure out what he did.

The table laughs. The WAITRESS comes over to the table.
She has the check, and a pot of coffee.

WAITRESS
Can I get anybody more
coffee.

JOE
No, we're gonna be hittin it.
I'll take care of the check.

She hands the bill to him.

WAITRESS
Here ya go. Please pay at the
register, if you wouldn't mind.

JOE
Sure thing.

WAITRESS
You guys have a wonderful day.

They all mutter equivalents. She exits and Joe stands up.

JOE
I'll take care of this, you guys
leave the tip.
(to Mr. White)
And when I come back, I want my
book back.

MR. WHITE
Sorry, it's my book now.

JOE
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit,
will ya?

Mr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger. Mr White
acts shot. Joe exits.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Okay, everybody cough up green for
the little lady.

Everybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table.
Everybody, that is, except Mr. White.

NICE GUY EDDIE
C'mon, throw in a buck.

MR. WHITE
Uh-uh. I don't tip.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?

MR. WHITE
I don't believe in it.

NICE GUY EDDIE
You don't believe in tipping?

MR. PINK
(laughing)
I love this kid, he's a madman,
this guy.

MR. BLONDE
Do you have any idea what these
ladies make? They make shit.

MR. WHITE
Don't give me that. She don't
make enough money, she can quit.

Everybody laughs.

NICE GUY EDDIE
I don't even know a Jew who'd have
the balls to say that. So let's
get this straight. You never ever
tip?

MR. WHITE
I don't tip because society says I
gotta. I tip when somebody
deserves a tip. When somebody
really puts forth an effort, they
deserve a little something extra.
But this tipping automatically,
that shit's for the birds. As far
as I'm concerned, they're just
doin their job.

MR. BLUE
Our girl was nice.

MR. WHITE
Our girl was okay. She didn't do
anything special.

MR. BLONDE
What's something special, take ya
in the kitchen and suck your dick?

They all laugh.

NICE GUY EDDIE
I'd go over twelve percent for
that.

MR. WRITE
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've
been here a long fuckin time, and
she's only filled my cup three
times. When I order coffee, I
want it filled six times.

MR. BLONDE
What if she's too busy?

MR. WHITE
The words "too busy" shouldn't be
in a waitress's vocabulary.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Excuse me, Mr. White, but the last
thing you need is another cup of
coffee.

They all laugh.

MR. WHITE
These ladies aren't starvin to
death. They make minimum wage.
When I worked for minimum wage, I
wasn't lucky enough to have a job
that society deemed tipworthy.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Ahh, now we're getting down to it.
It's not just that he's a cheap
bastard--

MR. ORANGE
--It is that too--

NICE GUY EDDIE
--It is that too. But it's also
he couldn't get a waiter job. You
talk like a pissed off dishwasher:
"Fuck those cunts and their
fucking tips."

MR. BLONDE
So you don't care that they're
counting on your tip to live?

Mr. White rubs two of his fingers together.

MR. WHITE
Do you know what this is? It's
the world's smallest violin,
playing just for the waitresses.

MR. BLONDE
You don't have any idea what
you're talking about. These
people bust their ass. This
is a hard job.

MR. WHITE
So's working at McDonald's, but
you don't feel the need to tip
them. They're servin ya food, you
should tip em. But no, society
says tip these guys over here, but
not those guys over there. That's
bullshit.

MR. ORANGE
They work harder than the kids at
McDonald's.

MR. WHITE
Oh yeah, I don't see them cleaning
fryers.

MR. BROWN
These people are taxed on the tips
they make. When you stiff 'em,
you cost them money.

MR. BLONDE
Waitressing is the number one
occupation for female non-college
graduates in this country. It's
the one jab basically any woman
can get, and make a living on.
The reason is because of tips.

MR. WHITE
Fuck all that.

They all laugh.

MR. WHITE
Hey, I'm very sorry that the
government taxes their tips.
That's fucked up. But that ain't
my fault. it would appear that
waitresses are just one of the
many groups the government fucks
in the ass on a regular basis.
You show me a paper says the
government shouldn't do that, I'll
sign it. Put it to a vote, I'll
vote for it. But what I won't do
is play ball. And this non-
college bullshit you're telling
me, I got two words for that:
"Learn to fuckin type." Cause if
you're expecting me to help out
with the rent, you're in for a big
fuckin surprise.

MR. ORANGE
He's convinced me. Give me my
dollar back.

Everybody laughs. Joe's comes back to the table.

JOE
Okay ramblers, let's get to
rambling. Wait a minute, who
didn't throw in?

MR. ORANGE
Mr. White.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
Mr. White?
(to Mr. White)
Why?

MR. ORANGE
He don't tip.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
He don't tip?
(to Mr. White)
You don't tip? Why?

MR. ORANGE
He don't believe in it.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
He don't believe in it?
(to Mr. White)
You don't believe in it?

MR. ORANGE
Nope.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
Shut up!
(to Mr. White)
Cough up the buck, ya cheap
bastard, I paid for your goddamn
breakfast.

MR. WHITE
Because you paid for the
breakfast, I'm gonna tip.
Normally I wouldn't.

JOE
Whatever. Just throw in your
dollar, and let's move.
(to Mr. Blonde)
See what I'm dealing with here.
Infants. I'm fuckin dealin with
infants.

The eight men get up to leave. Mr. White's waist is in
the F.G. As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's
carrying a gun. They exit Uncle Bob's Pancake House,
talking amongst themselves.


2 EXT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY

CREDIT SEQUENCE:

When the credit sequence is finished, we FADE TO BLACK:

Over the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in
agony.

Under the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING
ASS, through traffic.

Over the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY
ELSE SAY:

SOMEBODY ELSE (OS)
Just hold on buddy boy.

Somebody stops screaming long enough to say:

SOMEBODY (OS)
I'm sorry. I can't believe
she killed me. Who would've
fuckin thought that?

CUT TO:

3 INT. GETAWAY GAR (MOVING) - DAY

The Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange. He lies in the
backseat. He's been SHOT in the stomach. BLOOD covers
both him and the backseat.

Mr. White is the Somebody Else. He's behind the wheel of
the getaway car. He's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and
out of traffic. Though he's driving for his life, he
keeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat.

They are the only two in the car.

MR. WHITE
Hey, just cancel that shit right
now! You're hurt. You're hurt
really fucking bad, but you ain't
dying.

MR. ORANGE
(crying)
All this blood is scaring the shit
outta me. I'm gonna die, I know
it.

MR. WHITE
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you
had a degree in medicine. Are you
a doctor? Are you a doctor?
Answer me please, are you a
doctor?

MR. ORANGE
No, I'm not!

MR. WRITE
Ahhhh, so you admit you don't know
what you're talking about. So if
you're through giving me your
amateur opinion, lie back and
listen to the news. I'm taking
you back to the rendezvous, Joe's
gonna get you a doctor, the
doctor's gonna fix you up, and
you're gonna be okay. Now say it:
you're gonna be okay. Say it:
you're gonna be okay!

Mr. Orange doesn't respond. Mr. White starts pounding on
the steering wheel.

MR. WHITE
Say-the-goddamn-words: you're
gonna be okay!

MR. ORANGE
I'm okay.

MR. WHITE
(softly)
Correct.

4 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The CAMERA does a 360 around an empty warehouse. Then the
door swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of
Mr. Orange inside.

Mr. Orange still is MOANING loudly from his bullet hit.

Mr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor.

MR. WHITE
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on,
and wait for Joe. I can't do
anything for you, but when Joe
gets here, which should be anytime
now, he'll be able to help you.
We're just gonna sit here, and
wait for Joe. Who are
we waiting for?

MR. ORANGE
Joe.

MR. WHITE
Bet your sweet ass we are.

Mr. White gets up from over Mr. Orange and starts to prowl
around the warehouse.

MR. ORANGE
(yelling)
Don't leave me!

Mr White bends back over him and takes his hand.

MR. WHITE
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right
here. I'm not gonna leave ya.

MR. ORANGE
Larry, I'm so scared, would you
please hold me.

Mr. White very gently embraces the bloody Mr. Orange.
Cradling the young man, Mr. White whispers to him.

MR. WHITE
(whispering)
Go ahead and be scared, you've
been brave enough for one day. I
want you to just relax now.
You're not gonna die, you're gonna
be fine. When Joe gets here,
he'll make ya a hundred percent
again.

Mr. White lays Mr. Orange back down on the mattress. He's
still holding his hand. Mr. Orange looks up at his
friend.

MR. ORANGE
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in
the ointment, but if help doesn't
come soon, I gotta see a doctor.
I don't give a fuck about jail, I
just don't wanna die.

MR. WHITE
You're not gonna fucking die, all
right?

MR. ORANGE
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm
hurt, and I'm hurt bad.

MR. WHITE
It's not good...

MR. ORANGE
Hey, bless your heart for what
you're trying to do. I was
panicking for a moment, but I've
got my senses back now. The
situation is, I'm shot in the
belly. And without medical
attention, I'm gonna die.

MR. WHITE
I can' take you to a hospital.

MR. ORANGE
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit
about jail. But I can't die. You
don't have to take me in. Just
drive me up to the front, drop me
on the sidewalk. I'll take care
of myself. I won't tell them
anything. I swear to fucking god,
I won't tell 'em anything. Look
in my eyes, look right in my eyes.
(Mr. White does)
I-won't-tell-them-anything.
You'll be safe.

MR. WHITE
Lie back down, and try to--

MR. ORANGE
I'm going to die! I need a
doctor! I'm begging you,
take me to a doctor.

Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress. Spent from
his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:

MR. ORANGE
Take me to a doctor, take me to a
doctor, please.

Suddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr.
Pink steps inside.

MR. PINK
Was that a fucking set-up or what?

Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody.

MR. PINK
Oh fuck, Orange got tagged.

Throughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning.

MR. WHITE
Gun shot.

MR. PINK
Oh that's just fucking great!
Where's Brown?

MR. WHITE
Dead.

MR. PINK
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?

MR. WHITE
How the fuck do you think? The
cops shot him.

MR. PINK
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.
(referring to Mr.
Orange)
Is it bad?

MR. WHITE
As opposed to good?

MR. PINK
This is so fucked up. Somebody
fucked us big time.

MR. WHITE
You really think we were set up?

MR. PINK
You even doubt it? I don't think
we got set up, I know we got set
up! I mean really, seriously,
where did all those cops come
from, huh? One minute they're not
there, the next minute
they're there. I didn't hear any
sirens. The alarm went off, okay.
Okay, when an alarm goes off, you
got an average of four minutes
response time. Unless a patrol
car is cruising that street, at
that particular moment, you got
four minutes before they can
realistically respond. In one
minute there were seventeen blue
boys out there. All loaded for
bear, all knowing exactly what the
fuck they were doing, and they
were all just there! Remember
that second wave that showed up in
the cars? Those were the ones
responding to the alarm. but
those other motherfuckers were
already there, they were waiting
for us.
(pause)
You haven't thought about this?

MR. WHITE
I haven't had a chance to think.
First I was just trying to get the
fuck outta there. And after we
got away, I've just been dealin
with him.

MR. PINK
Well, you better start thinking
about it. Cause I, sure as fuck,
am thinking about it. In fact,
that's all I'm thinking about. I
came this close to just driving
off. Whoever set us up, knows
about this place. There could've
been cops sitting here waiting for
me. For all we know, there's
cops, driving fast, on their way
here now.

MR. WHITE
Let's go in the other room...

The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner. We
move past it, and see down a hall.

5 INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY

At the end of the hall is a bathroom. The bathroom door
is partially closed, restricting our view. Mr. Pink is
obscured, but Mr. White is in view.

MR. PINK (OS)
What the fuck am I doing here? I
felt funny about this job right
off. As soon as I felt it I
should said "No thank you", and
walked. But I never fucking
listen. Every time I ever got
burned buying weed, I always knew
the guy wasn't right. I just felt
it. But I wanted to believe him.
If he's not lyin to me, and it
really is Thai stick, then whoa
baby. But it's never Thai stick.
and I always said if I felt that
way about a job, I'd walk. And I
did, and I didn't, because of
fuckin money!

MR. WHITE
What's done is done, I need you
cool. Are you cool?

MR. PINK
I'm cool.

MR. WHITE
Splash some water on your face.
Take a breather.

We hear the sink running, and Mr. Pink splashing water on
his face.

MR. WHITE
I'm gonna get me my smokes.

Mr White opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and
OUT OF FRAME. We see Mr. Pink, his back turned towards
us, bent over the sink. Then he grabs a towels, and dries
his face. Mr White ENTERS FRAME with a pack of
Chesterfields in his hand.

MR. WHITE
Want a smoke?

MR. PINK
Why not?

The two men light up.

MR. WHITE
Okay, let's go through what
happened. We're in the place,
everything's going fine. Then the
alarm gets tripped. I turn around
and all these cops are outside.
You're right, it was like, bam! I
blink my eyes are they're there.
Everybody starts going apeshit.
Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin all
the--

MR. PINK
--That's not correct.

MR. WHITE
What's wrong with it?

MR. PINK
The cops didn't show up after the
alarm went off. They didn't show
till after Mr. Blonde started
shooting everyone.

MR. WHITE
As soon as I heard the alarm, I
saw the cops.

MR. PINK
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that
soon. They didn't let their
presence be known until after Mr.
Blonde went off. I'm not sayin
they weren't there, I'm sayin they
were there. But they didn't move
in till Mr. Blonde became a
madman. That's how I know we were
set up. You can see that,
can't you, Mr. White?

MR. WHITE
Look, enough of this "Mr White"
shit--

MR. PINK
--Don't tell me your name, I don't
want to know! I sure as hell
ain't gonna tell ya
mine.

MR. WHITE
You're right, this is bad.
(pause)
How did you get out?

MR. PINK
Shot my way out. Everybody was
shooting, so I just blasted my way
outta there.

CUT TO:


6 EXT. CROWDED CITY STREET - DAY

Mr. Pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk. He has
a canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a .357
MAGNUM in the other. If any BYSTANDERS get in his way, he
just knocks them down. We DOLLY at the same speed, right
along side of him.

FOUR POLICEMEN are running after Mr. Pink. We DOLLY with
them.

We DOLLY with a young woman on roller skates. ROLLERGIRL
is plugged into a walkman. We hear the song she's
listening to LOUD over the SOUNDTRACK. She's twirling and
skating backwards to the beat of the song.

Rollergirl turns a corner and COLLIDES with Mr. Pink. The
man and woman CRASH to the ground.

Mr. Pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car
that SCREECHES to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over
him.


7 INT. CAR (STOPPED) - DAY

The CAMERA is in the backseat. A SHOCKED WOMAN is the
car's driver. Mr. Pink pulls himself up from the hood,
shakes it off, and points his magnum at the driver.

MR. PINK
Get outta the car! Get the fuck
outta the car!

The Shocked Woman starts screaming.

Mr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's
locked.

MR. PINK
Open the fucking door!

EXTREME C.U. DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW

Mr. Pink SMASHES it in our face.


8 EXT. STREET - DAY

DOLLY with Cops coming up fast.

Mr. Pink DRAGS the Shocked Woman out of the car.

The Cops reach the corner, guns aimed.

Using the car as a shield, Mr. Pink FIRES three shots at
the Cops.

Everybody HITS the ground, or scatters.

Mr. Pink HOPS in the car.

Cops FIRE.


9 INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

CAMERA in the backseat, Mr. Pink FLOORS it. SPEEDING down
the street, with the Cops FIRING after him.

BACK TO:


10 INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Mr. Pink and Mr. White still talking in the bathroom.

MR. PINK
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you
kill anybody?

MR. WHITE
A few cops.

MR. PINK
No real people?

MR. WHITE
Uh-uh, just cops.

MR. PINK
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

MR. WHITE
That was one of the most insane
fucking things I've ever seen.
Why the fuck would Joe hire
somebody like that?

MR. PINK
I don't wanna kill anybody. But
if I gotta get out that door, and
you're standing in my way, one way
of the other, you're gettin outta
my way.

MR. WHITE
That's the way I look at it. A
choice between doin ten years, and
takin out some stupid
motherfucker, ain't no choice at
all. But I ain't no madman
either. What the fuck was Joe
thinkin? You can't work with a
guy like that. That mother-
fucker's unstable. What do you
think? Do you think he panicked,
or ya think he's just trigger-
happy?

MR. PINK
I think he's a sick fuckin maniac!
We're awful goddamn lucky he
didn't tag us, when
he shot up the place. I came this
fucking close--
(hold up two fingers
and makes a tiny
space between them)
--to taking his ass out myself.
Everybody panics. When things get
tense, everybody panics.
Everybody. I don't care what your
name is, you can't help it. It's
human nature. But ya panic on the
inside.
Ya panic in your head. Ya give
yourself a couple a seconds of
panic, then you get a grip and
deal with the situation. What you
don't do, is shoot up the place
and kill everybody.

MR. WHITE
What you're supposed to do is act
like a fuckin professional. A
psychopath is not a professional.
You can't work with a psychopath,
'cause ya don't know what those
sick assholes are gonna do next.
I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do
you think that black girl was?
Twenty, maybe twenty-one?

MR. PINK
Did ya see what happened to
anybody else?

MR. WHITE
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the
car and Mr. Brown floored it.
After that, I don't know what went
down.

MR. PINK
At that point it became every man
for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde
or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't
got the foggiest. Once
I got out, I never looked back.

MR. WHITE
What do you think?

MR. PINK
What do I think? I think the cops
caught them, or killed 'em.

MR. WHITE
Not even a chance they punched
through? You found a hole.

MR. PINK
Yeah, and that was a fucking
miracle. But if they did get
away, where the fuck are they?

MR. WHITE
You don't think it's possible, one
of them got ahold of the diamonds
and pulled a--

MR. PINK
Nope.

MR. WHITE
How can you be so sure?

MR. PINK
I got the diamonds.

MR. WHITE
Where?

MR. PINK
I got 'em, all right?

MR. WHITE
Where? Are they out in the car?

MR. PINK
No, they're not in the car. No, I
don't have them on me. Ya wanna
go with me and get 'em? Yes, we
can go right now. But first
listen to what I'm telling you.
We were fuckin set up! Somebody
is in league with the cops. We
got a Judas in our midst. And I'm
thinkin we should have our fuckin
heads examined for waiting around
here.

MR. WHITE
That was the plan, we meet here.

MR. PINK
Then where is everybody? I say
the plan became null and void once
we found out we got a rat in the
house. We ain't got the slightest
fuckin idea what happened to Mr.
Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could
both be dead
or arrested. They could be
sweatin 'em, down at the station
house right now. Yeah they don't
know the names, but they can sing
about this place.
I mean, that could be happening
right now. As we speak, the cops
could be in their cars, drivin
here this minute.

MR. WHITE
I swear to god I'm fuckin jinxed.

MR. PINK
What?

MR. WHITE
Two jobs back, it was a four man
job, we discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop.

MR. PINK
No shit?

MR. WHITE
Thank god, we discovered in time.
We hadda forget the whole fuckin
thing. Just walked away from it.

MR. PINK
So who's the rat this time? Mr.
Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's
Joe's show, he set this whole
thing up. Maybe he set it up to
set it up.

MR. WHITE
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go
back a long time. I can tell ya
straight up, Joe definitely didn't
have anything to do with this
bullshit.

MR. PINK
Oh, you and Joe go back a long
time. I known Joe since I was a
kid. But me saying Joe definitely
couldn't have done it is
ridiculous. I can say I
definitely didn't do it, cause I
know what I did or didn't do. But
I can't definitely say that about
anybody else, 'cause I don't
definitely know. For all I know,
you're the rat.

MR. WHITE
For all I know, you're the rat.

MR. PINK
Now you're using your head. For
all we know, he's the rat.

Mr. Pink points OFFSCREEN to Mr. Orange. Mr. White's
expression changes.

MR. WHITE
Jesus Christ!


11 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

They run over to Mr. Orange, who's unconscious. The
CAMERA hovers over the action. Mr. Pink reaches him
first.

MR. PINK
Is he dead?

Mr. White pushes him out of the way. He feels the pulse
on Mr. Orange's neck.

MR. PINK
So, is he dead or what?

MR. WHITE
He ain't dead.

MR. PINK
So what is it?

MR. WHITE
I think he's just passed out.

MR. PINK
He scared the fuckin shit outta
me. I thought he was dead fer
sure.

Mr. White stands up and walks over to a table.

MR. WHITE
He will be dead fer sure, if we
don't get him to a hospital.

MR. PINK
We can't take him to a hospital.

MR. WHITE
Without medical attention, this
man won't live through the night.
That bullet in his belly is my
fault. Now while that might not
mean jack shit to you, it means a
helluva lot to me. And I'm not
gonna just sit around and watch
him die.

MR. PINK
Well, first things first, staying
here's goofy. We gotta book up.

MR. WHITE
So what do you suggest, we go to a
hotel? We got a guy who's shot in
the belly, he can't walk, he
bleeds like a stuck pig, and when
he's awake, he screams in pain.

MR. PINK
You gotta idea, spit it out.

MR. WHITE
Joe could help him. If we can get
in touch with Joe, Joe could get
him to a doctor, Joe could get a
doctor to come and see him.

During Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a
C.U. of Mr. White.

MR. PINK (OS)
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we
gonna get in touch with him? He's
supposed to be here, but he ain't,
which is making me nervous about
being here. Even if Joe is
on the up and up, he's probably
not gonna be that happy with us.
Joe planned a robbery, but he's
got a blood bath on his hands now.
Dead cops, dead robbers, dead
civilians...Jesus Christ! I tend
to doubt he's gonna have a lot of
sympathy for our plight. If I was
him, I'd try and put as much
distance between me and this mess
an humanly possible.

MR. WHITE
Before you got here, Mr. Orange
was askin me to take him to a
hospital. Now I don't like
turning him over to the cops, but
if we don't, he's dead. He begged
me to do it. I told him to hold
off till Joe got here.

MR. PINK (OS)
Well Joe ain't gettin here. We're
on our own. Now, I don't know a
goddamn body who can help him, so
if you know somebody, call 'em.

MR. WHITE
I don't know anybody.

MR. PINK (OS)
Well, I guess we drop him off at
the hospital. Since he don't know
nothin about us, I say it's his
decision.


MR. WHITE'S POV:

C.U. OF MR. PINK.

MR. WHITE (OS)
Well, he knows a little about me.

MR. PINK
You didn't tell him your name, did
ya?

MR. WHITE (OS)
I told him my first name, and
where I'm from.

There is a long silence and a blank look from Mr. Pink,
then he SCREAMS:

MR. PINK
Why!

MR. WHITE (OS)
I told him where I was from a few
days ago. It was just a casual
conversation.

MR. PINK
And what was tellin him your name
when you weren't supposed to?

MR. WHITE (OS)
He asked.

Mr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he's retarded.

MR. WHITE (OS)
We had just gotten away from the
cops. He just got shot. It was
my fuckin fault he got shot. He's
a fuckin bloody mess - he's
screaming. I swear to god, I
thought we was gonna die right
then and there. I'm tryin to
comfort him, telling him not to
worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm
gonna take care of him. And he
asked me what my name was. I
mean, the man was dyin in my arms.
What the fuck was I supposed to
tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out
that information, it's against the
rules. I don't trust you
enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I
couldn't.

MR. PINK
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite
beautiful--

MR. WHITE (OS)
Don't fuckin patronize me.

MR. PINK
One question: Do they have a sheet
on you, where you told him you're
from?

MR. WHITE (OS)
Of course.

MR. PINK
Well that's that, then. I mean, I
was worried about mug shot
possibilities already. But now he
knows: (a) what you look like, (b)
what your first name is,
(i) where you're from and (d) what
your specialty is.
They ain't gonna hafta show him a
helluva lot of pictures for him to
pick you out. That's it right,
you didn't tell him anything else
that could narrow down the
selection?

MR. WHITE (OS)
If I have to tell you again to
back off, me an you are gonna go
round and round.

Mr. Pink walks out of the C.U. and turns his back on Mr.
White. Mr. White's POV PANS over to him.

MR. PINK
We ain't taking him to a hospital.

MR. WHITE (OS)
If we don't, he'll die.

MR. PINK
And I'm very sad about that. But
some fellas are lucky, and some
ain't.

MR. WHITE (OS)
That fuckin did it!

Mr. White's POV CHARGES toward Mr. Pink.

Mr. Pink turns toward him in time to get PUNCHED hard in
the mouth.

END OF POV

Mr. White and Mr. Pink have a very ungraceful and
realistic fight. They go at each other like a couple of
alley cats.

As Mr. White SWINGS and PUNCHES, he SCREAMS:

MR. WHITE

You little motherfucker!

Mr. Pink YELLS as he HITS:

MR. PINK
Ya wanna fuck with me?! You wanna
fuck with me?! I'll show you who
you're fuckin with!

The two men end up on the floor KICKING and SCRATCHING.

Mr. White gets Mr. Pink in a HEADLOCK.

Mr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it
out.

Mr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink,
and goes for his own weapon.

The two men are on the floor, on their knees, with their
guns outstretched, aiming at one another.

MR. WHITE
You wanna shoot me, you little
piece of shit? Take a shot!

MR. PINK
Fuck you, White! I didn't create
this situation, I'm just dealin
with it. You're acting like a
first-year fuckin thief. I'm
actin like a professional. They
get him, they can get you, they
get you, they get closer to me,
and that can't happen. And you,
you motherfucker, are looking at
me like it's my fault. I didn't
tell him my name. I didn't tell
him where I was from. I didn't
tell him what I knew better than
to tell him. Fuck, fifteen
minutes ago, you almost told me
your name. You, buddy, are stuck
in a situation you created. So if
you wanna throw bad looks
somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.

Mr. Pink lowers his gun and walks towards White.

MR. PINK
So if you wanna shoot somebody,
put that gun in your mouth and
shoot yourself.

Then from OFF SCREEN we hear:

VOICE (OS)
You kids don't play so rough.
Somebody's gonna start crying.


12 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MEDIUM C.U. ON MR. BLONDE

The Voice belongs to the infamous Mr. Blonde.

Mr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke
and eating a hot dog.

MR. PINK
Mr. Blonde! You okay? We thought
you might've gotten caught. What
happened?

Mr. Blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter
and starts walking around the warehouse, checking the
place out.

He doesn't look at either Mr. Pink or Mr. White, he
just eats his hot dog and sips his coke.

This is making Pink and White nervous as hell. But Mr.
Pink tries to talk through it.

We HANDHOLD follow Mr. Blonde around the warehouse.

MR. PINK
Really, how did you get away?

Mr. Blonde walks the loft. Silent.

MR. PINK
You saw what happened to me,
I found a hole and booked.

Silence.

MR. PINK
Where's Mr. Blue?

Blonde looks in the bathroom.

MR. PINK
We were hopin you two would be
together.

Blonde looks out the window.

MR. PINK
That was the big question we had,
what happened to Mr.
Blue and you?

Blonde walks away from the window.

MR. PINK
We were worried the cops got ya.

Blonde bends down over Mr. Orange.

MR. PINK
He got it in the belly. He's
still alive, but won't be for
long.

MR. WHITE
Enough! You better start talkin
to us, asshole, cause we got shit
we need to talk about. We're
already freaked out, we need you
actin freaky like we need a fuckin
bag on our hip.

Mr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime, then moves
towards them.

MR. BLONDE
So, talk.

MR. WHITE
We think we got a rat in the
house.

MR. PINK
I guarantee we got a rat in the
house.

MR. BLONDE
What would ever make you think
that?

MR. WHITE
Is that supposed to be funny?

MR. PINK
We don't think this place is safe.

MR. WHITE
This place just ain't secure
anymore. We're leaving, and you
should go with us.

MR. BLONDE
Nobody's going anywhere.

Silence takes over the room. Mr. Blonde stops moving.

After a few beats the silence is broken.

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Pink)
Piss on this turd, we're outta
here.

Mr. White turns to leave.

MR. BLONDE
Don't take another step, Mr.
White.

Mr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards
Mr. Blonde.

MR. WHITE
Fuck you, maniac! It's your
fuckin fault we're in so much
trouble.

Mr. Blonde calmly sits down. He looks to Mr. Pink.

MR. BLONDE
(referring to Mr.
White)
What's this guy's problem?

MR. WHITE
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta
problem. I gotta big problem with
any trigger-happy madman who
almost gets me shot!

MR. BLONDE
What're you talkin about?

MR. WHITE
That fuckin shooting spree in the
store.

MR. BLONDE
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm,
they deserve what they got.

MR. WHITE
You almost killed me, asshole! If
I had any idea what type of guy
you were, I never would've agreed
to work with you.

MR. BLONDE
You gonna back all day, little
doggie, or are you gonna bite?

MR. WHITE
What was that? I'm sorry, I
didn't catch it. Would you repeat
it?

MR. BLONDE
(slowly)
I said: "Are you gonna bark all
day, dog, or are you gonna bite."

MR. PINK
Both of you two assholes knock it
the fuck off and calm down!

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Blonde)
So you wanna git bit, huh?

MR. PINK
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a
fuckin playground!
(pause)
I don't believe this shit, both of
you got ten years on me, and I'm
the only one actin like a
professional. You guys act like a
bunch of fuckin niggers. You ever
work a job with a bunch of
niggers? They're just like you
two, always fightin, always sayin
they're gonna kill one another.

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Pink)
You said yourself, you
thought about takin him out.

MR. PINK
Then. That time has passed.
Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only
one I completely trust. He's too
fuckin homicidal to be workin with
the cops.

MR. WHITE
You takin his side?

MR. PINK
Fuck sides! What we need is a
little solidarity here.
Somebody's stickin a red hot poker
up our asses and we gotta find out
whose hand's on the handle. Now I
know I'm no piece of shit...
(referring to Mr.
White)
And I'm pretty sure you're a good
boy...
(referring to Mr.
Blonde)
And I'm fuckin positive you're on
the level. So let's figure out
who's the bad guy.

Mr. White calms down and puts his gun away.

Mr. Blonde returns to the persona we saw at the beginning,
talking about Madonna.

MR. BLONDE
Well, that was sure exciting.
(to Mr. White)
You're a big Lee Marvin fan,
aren't you? Me too. I don't know
about the rest of you fellas, but
my heart's
beatin fast.
(pause for a beat)
Okay you guys, follow me.

Mr. Blonde hops out of his chair and heads for the door.

The other two men just follow him with their eyes.

MR. WHITE
Follow you where?

MR. BLONDE
Down to my car.

MR. WHITE
Why?

MR. BLONDE
It's a surprise.

Mr. Blonde walks out.


13 EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

Three cars are parked out front. Mr. Blonde is walking
towards the car he drove. Mr. White and Mr. Pink are
walking behind. The Camera is HANDHELD following behind
them.

MR. PINK
We still gotta get out of here.

MR. BLONDE
We're gonna sit here and wait.

MR. WHITE
For what, the cops?

MR. BLONDE
Nice Guy Eddie.

MR. PINK
Nice Guy Eddie? What makes you
think Nice Guy's anywhere but on a
plane half way to Costa Rica?

MR. BLONDE
Cause I just talked to him. He's
on his way down here, and nobody's
going anywhere till be gets here.

MR. WHITE
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why
the fuck didn't you say that in
the first place?

MR. BLONDE
You didn't ask.

MR. WHITE
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he
say?

MR. BLONDE
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a
look at the little surprise I
brought you.

Mr. Blonde opens up the truck of his car. A handcuffed,
uniformed POLICEMAN is curled up inside the trunk.

MR. BLONDE
So while we're waitin for Nice Guy
Eddie, what say we have a little
fun finding out who the rat is.


INSERT: TITLE CARD "MR. BLONDE".


14 INT. JOE CABOT'S OFFICE - DAY

We're inside the office of Joe Cabot. Joe's on the phone,
sitting behind his desk.

JOE
(into phone)
Sid, I'm tellin you don't worry
about it. You had a bad couple of
months, it happens.
(pause)
Sid, Sid, Sid...Stop, you're
embarrassing me. I don't need to
be told what I already know. When
you have bad months, you do what
every business man in the
worlds does, I don't care if he's
Donald Trump or Irving the tailor.
Ya ride it out.

There's a KNOCK on Cabot's office door.

JOE
Come in.

One of Cabot's goons, TEDDY, opens the door and steps
inside. Cabot covers the receiver with his hand and looks
towards the man.

TEDDY
Vic Vega's outside.

JOE
Tell him to come in.

Teddy leaves.

JOE
(into phone)
Sid, a friend of mine's here. I
gotta go.
(pause)
Good enough, bye.

He hangs up the phone, stands, and walks around to the
front of the desk.

Teddy opens the office door, and TOOTHPICK VIC VEGA walks
in.

Toothpick Vic Vega is none other than our very own Mr.
Blonde. Vic is dressed in a long black leather seventies
style jacket.

Joe stands in front of his desk with his arms open.

The two men embrace each other. Teddy leaves, closing the
door behind him.

JOE
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin
good, ain't it?

VIC
It's a change.

JOE
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy
Martin?

VIC
Sure.

JOE
Take a seat.

Joe goes over to his liquor cabinet. Vic sits in a chair
set in front of Joe's desk.

JOE
(while he pours the
drink)
Who's your parole officer?

VIC
A guy named Koons. Craig Koons.

JOE
How is he?

VIC
Fuckin asshole, won't let me leave
the halfway house.

JOE
Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin
jungle bunny goes out there, slits
some old woman's throat for
twenty-five cents. Fuckin nigger
gets Doris Day as a parole
officer. But a good fella like
you gets stuck with a ball-bustin
prick.

Joe walks back around his desk and sits in his chair.

Vic swallows some Remy.

VIC
I just want you to know, Joe, how
much I appreciate your care
packages on the inside.

JOE
What the hell did you expect me to
do? Just forget about you?

VIC
I just wanted you to know, they
meant a lot.

JOE
It's the least I could do Vic. I
wish I coulda done more.
(Joe flashes a side
grin at Vic)
Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a
story? What're your plans?

VIC
Well, what I wanna do is go back
to work. But I got this Koons
prick deep up my ass. He won't
let me leave the halfway house
till I get some piece of shit job.
My plans have always been to be
part of the team again.

There's a KNOCK at the door.

JOE
Come in.

The door opens and in walks Joe's son, Nice Guy Eddie.
Vic turns around in his seat and sees him.

EDDIE
(to Vic)
I see ya sittin here, but I don't
believe it.

Vic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie.

EDDIE
How ya doin, Toothpick?

VIC
Fine, now.

EDDIE
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked
you up personally at the pen.
This whole week's just been crazy.
I've had my head up my ass the
entire time.

VIC
Funny you should mention it.
That's what your father and I been
talkin about.

EDDIE
That I should've picked you up?

VIC
No. That your head's been up your
ass. I walk through the door and
Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank
god. Finally somebody who knows
what the fuck he's doing. Vic,
Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck
up." And I say "Well, Joe, I
coulda told you that." "I'm
ruined! He's ruining me! My son,
I love him, but he's taking my
business and flushing it down the
fuckin toilet!"
(to Joe)
I'm not tellin tales out of
school. You tell 'im Joe.
Tell 'im yourself.

JOE
Eddie, I hate like hell for you to
hear it this way. But when Vic
asked me how's business, well, you
don't lie to a man who's just done
four years in the slammer for ya.

Eddie bobs his head up and down.

EDDIE
Oh really, is that a fact?

Eddie JUMPS Vic and they fall to the floor.

The two friends, laughing and cussing at each other,
wrestle on the floor of Joe's office.

Joe's on his feet yelling at them.

JOE
(yelling)
Okay, okay, enough, enough!
Playtime's over! You wanna roll
around on the floor, do it in
Eddie's office, not mine!

The two men break it up. They are completely disheveled,
hair a mess, shirttails out. As they get themselves
together, they continue to taunt one another.

EDDIE
Daddy, did ya see that?

JOE
What?

EDDIE
Guy got me on the ground, tried to
fuck me.

VIC
You fuckin wish.

EDDIE
You tried to fuck me in my
father's office, you sick bastard.
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do
in the privacy of your own home,
go do it. But don't try to fuck
me. I don't think of you that
way. I mean, I like you a lot--

VIC
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I
wouldn't throw you to the crew.

EDDIE
No, you'd keep me for yourself.
Four years fuckin punks in the ass
made you appreciate prime rib when
you get it.

VIC
I might break you, Nice Guy, but
I'd make you my dog's bitch.
You'd be suckin the dick and going
down on a mangy T-bone hound.

EDDIE
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy,
walks into jail a white man, walks
out talkin like a nigger. It's
all that black semen been shootin
up his butt. It's backed up into
his brain and comes out of his
mouth.

JOE
Are you two finished? We were
talkin about some serious shit
when you came in Eddie. We got a
big problem we're tryin to solve.
Now Eddie, would you like to sit
down and help us solve it, or do
you two wanna piss fart around?

Playtime is over and Vic and Eddie know it. So they both
take seats in front of Joe's desk.

JOE
Now Vic was tellin me, he's got a
parole problem.

EDDIE
Really? Who's your P.O.?

VIC
Craig Koons.

EDDIE
Koons? Oh shit, I hear he's a
motherfucker.

VIC
He is a motherfucker. He won't
let me leave the halfway house
till I get some piece of shit job.

EDDIE
You're coming back to work for us,
right?

VIC
I wanna. But I gotta show this
asshole I got an honest-to-
goodness job before he'll let me
move out on my own. I can't work
for you guys and be worried about
gettin back before ten o'clock
curfew.

JOE
(to Eddie)
We can work this out, can't we?

EDDIE
This isn't all that bad. We can
give you a lot of legitimate jobs.
Put you on the rotation at Long
Beach as a dock worker.

VIC
I don't wanna lift crates.

EDDIE
You don't hafta lift shit. You
don't really work there. But as
far as the records are concerned,
you do. I call up Matthews, the
foreman, tell him he's got a new
guy. You're on the schedule. You
got a timecard, it's clocked in
and out for you everyday, and you
get a pay check at the end of the
week. And ya know dock workers
don't do too bad. So you can move
into a halfway decent place
without Koons thinkin "what the
fuck." And if Koons ever wants to
make a surprise visit, you're gone
that day. That day we sent you to
Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit
you needed to unload there.
You're at the Taft airstrip pickin
up a bunch of shit and bringing it
back. Part of your jab is goin
different places - and we got
places all over the place.

JOE
(to Vic)
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?
(to Eddie)
Vic was worried.

EDDIE
Me and you'll drive down to Long
Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce
you to Matthews, tell him what's
going on.

VIC
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.
(pause)
When do you think you'll need me
for real work?

JOE
Well, it's kinda a strange time
right now. Things are kinda--

EDDIE
--Nuts. We got a big meeting in
Vegas coming up. And we're kinda
just gettin ready for that right
now.

JOE
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long
Beach. Give ya some cash, get
that Koons fuck off your back, and
we'll be talking to ya.

EDDIE
Daddy, I got an idea. Now just
hear it out. I know you don't
like to use any of the boys on
these jobs, but technically, Vic
ain't one of the boys. He's been
gone for four years. He ain't on
no one's list. Ya know he can
handle himself, ya know you can
trust him.

Joe looks at Vic.

Vic has no idea what they're talking about.

JOE
How would you feel about pullin a
heist with about five other guys?

VIC
What's the exposure like?

JOE
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough
two minutes. It's a hold up,
daylight, during business hours,
dealing with a crowd. But you
have the fellas to deal with the
crowd. It's a jewelry store.
They're getting a big shipment of
South African diamonds on a
certain day. They're like a way
station. It's gonna get picked up
the next day and sent to Hamburg.
When you walk through the door,
you'll know right where to go for
the rich stones.
The fellas are good, me and Nice
Guy picked em. Nobody knows
anybody else. Nobody's connected.
I don't use connected guys for
this shit.

VIC
What's the cut?

JOE
Juicy, man, real juicy.

Toothpick Vic smiles.

So does Nice Guy Eddie.

CUT TO:


15 INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Nice Guy Eddie is driving to the rendezvous talking on his
portable car phone. The sounds of the seventies are
coming out of his car radio in the form of "Love Goes
Where My Rosemary Goes" by Edison Lighthouse.

EDDIE
(into phone)
Hey Dov, we got a major situation
here.
(pause)
I know you know that. I gotta
talk with daddy and find out what
he wants done.


FLASH ON

16 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The Cop is standing in the warehouse with his hands cuffed
behind his back. Mr. White, Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde
surround him and proceed to beat the shit out of him.
"Love Grows .." PLAYS over the soundtrack.


17 BACK TO NICE GUY EDDIE

EDDIE
(into phone)
All I know is what Vic told me.
He said the place turned into a
fuckin bullet festival. He took a
cop as hostage, just to get the
fuck out of there.


FLASH ON

18 WAREHOUSE

The three men are stomping the cop into the ground.


19 BACK TO EDDIE

EDDIE
(into phone)
Do I sound like I'm jokin? He's
fuckin driving around with the cop
in his trunk.
(pause)
I don't know who did that. I
don't know who has the loot, if
anybody has the loot. Who's dead,
who's alive, who's caught, who's
not...
I will know, I'm practically
there. But what do I tell these
guys about daddy?
(pause)
You sure that's what he said?
(pause)
Okay, that's what I'll tell em.

CUT TO:


20 EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

Three cars belonging to the other guys are parked outside
the warehouse.

Eddie drives his car up to the warehouse. He gets out of
the car, looks at the other cars parked outside.

EDDIE
(to himself)
Fucking assholes.

Eddie makes a beeline for the front door, BANGS it open,
and steps inside the warehouse.


21 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The robbers have the cop tied to a chair and are still
WAILING on him.

Nice Guy Eddie walks in and everybody jumps.

EDDIE
What in Sam Hill is goin on?

Mr. Pink and Mr. White speak together.

MR. PINK MR. WHITE
Hey, Nice Guy, we got a You're askin what's goin
cop. on? Where the fuck is
Joe?

Nice Guy sees Mr. Orange.

EDDIE
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked
up!

MR. WHITE
No shit, he's gonna fuckin die on
us if we don't get him taken care
of.

MR. PINK
We were set up, the cops were
waiting for us.

EDDIE
What? Nobody set anybody up.

MR. PINK
The cops were there waitin for us!

EDDIE
Bullshit.

MR. PINK
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't
there, we were. And I'm tellin
ya, the cops had that store staked
out.

EDDIE
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?

MR. PINK
What the fuck d'you think we've
been askin each other?

EDDIE
And what are your answers? Was it
me? You think I set you up?

MR. PINK
I don't know, but somebody did.

EDDIE
Nobody did. You assholes turn the
jewelry store into a wild west
show, and you wonder why cops show
up.

MR. BLONDE
Where's Joseph?

EDDIE
I ain't talked to him. I talked
to Dov. Dov said he's comin out
here, and he's fucking pissed.

MR. PINK
(to Mr. White)
I told ya he'd be pissed.

MR. WHITE
(pointing to Mr.
Orange)
What are you gonna do about him?

EDDIE
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin
chance to breathe. I got a few
questions of my own, ya know.

MR. WHITE
You ain't dying, he is.

EDDIE
I'll call somebody.

MR. WHITE
Who?

EDDIE
A snake charmer, what the fuck
d'you think. I'll call a doctor,
take care of him, fix 'm right up.
No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr.
Blue?

MR. PINK
Brown's dead, we don't know about
Blue.

EDDIE
Nobody saw what happened to Mr.
Blue?

MR. BLONDE
Well, he's either dead or he's
alive or the cops got him or they
don't.

DOLLY to MEDIUM on the cop.

EDDIE (OS)
I take it this is the bastard you
told me about.
(referring to the
cop)
Why the hell are you beating on
him?

MR. PINK
So he'll tell us who the fuck set
us up.

EDDIE
Would you stop it with that shit!
You beat on this prick enough,
he'll tell ya he started the
Chicago fire. That don't
necessarily make it so. Okay,
first things fucking last, where's
the shit? Please tell me somebody
brought something
with them.

MR. PINK
I got a bag. I stashed it till I
could be sure this place wasn't a
police station.

EDDIE
Well, let's go get it. We also
gotta get rid of all those cars.
It looks like Sam's hot car lot
outside.
(pointing to Mr.
Blonde)
You stay here and babysit Orange
and the cop.
(referring to Mr.
Pink and Mr. White)
You two take a car each, I'll
follow ya. You ditch it, I'll
pick you up, then we'll pick up
the stones. And while I'm
following you, I'll arrange for
some sort of a doctor for our
friend.

MR. WHITE
We can't leave these guys with
him.

Meaning Mr. Blonde.

EDDIE
Why not?

Mr. White crosses to Mr. Blonde.

MR. WHITE
Because this guy's a fucking
psycho. And if you think
Joe's pissed at us, that
ain't nothing compared to how
pissed off I am at him, for puttin
me in the same room as this
bastard.

MR. BLONDE
(to Eddie)
You see what I been puttin up
with? As soon as I walk through
the door I'm hit with this shit.
I tell 'm what you told me about
us stayin put and Mr. White whips
out his gun, sticks it in my face,
and starts screaming "You
motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you
away, blah, blah, blah."

MR. WHITE
He's the reason the place turned
into a shooting gallery.
(to Mr. Pink)
What are you, a silent partner?
Fuckin tell him.

MR. PINK
He seems all right now, but he
went crazy in the store.

MR. WHITE
This is what he was doin.

Mr. White acts out Mr. Blonde shooting everybody in the
store.

MR. BLONDE
I told 'em not to touch the alarm.
They touched it. I blew 'em full
of holes. If they hadn't done
what I told 'em not it, they'd
still be alive.

MR. WHITE
That's your excuse for going on a
kill crazy rampage?

MR. BLONDE
I don't like alarms.

EDDIE
What does it matter who stays with
the cop? We ain't lettin him go.
Not after he's seen everybody.
You should've never took him outta
your trunk in the first place.

MR. PINK
We were trying to find out what he
knew about the set up.

EDDIE
There is no fuckin set up!
(Eddie takes charge)
Look, this is the news. Blondie,
you stay here and take care of
them two. White and Pink come
with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and
sees all those fucking cars
parked out front, he's going to be
as mad at me as he is at you.

Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk out of the warehouse
talking amongst themselves.


22 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MR. BLONDE AND COP

Mr. Blonde closes the door after them. He then slowly
turns his head towards the cop.

MR. BLONDE
Alone at last.


C.U. COP'S FACE.

MR. BLONDE (OS)
Now where were we?

COP
I told you I don't know anything
about any fucking set up. I've
only been on the force eight
months, nobody tells me anything!
I don't know anything! You can
torture me if you want--

MR. BLONDE (OS)
--Thanks, don't mind if I do.

COP
Your boss even said there wasn't a
set up.

MR. BLONDE (OS)
First off, I don't have a boss.
Are you clear about that?

He SLAPS the cop's face.

MR. BLONDE (OS)
I asked you a question. Are you
clear about that?

COP
Yes.

MR. BLONDE (OS)
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I
don't really care about what you
know or don't know. I'm gonna
torture you for awhile regardless.
Not to get information, but
because torturing a cop amuses me.
There's nothing you can say,
there's nothing you can do.
Except pray for death.

He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth.


COP'S POV

Mr. Blonde walks away from the cop.

MR. BLONDE
Let's see what's on K-BILLY'S
"super sounds of the seventies"
weekend.

He turns on the radio.

Stealer's Wheel's hit "Stuck in the Middle with You" PLAYS
over the speaker.

NOTE: This entire sequence is timed to the music.

Mr. Blonde slowly walks toward the cop.

He opens a large knife.

He grabs a chair, places it in front of the cop and sits
in it.

Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, holding
the knife, singing along with the song.

Then, like a cobra, he LASHES out.

A SLASH across the face.

The cop/camera moves around wildly.

Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, singing
along with the seventies hit.

Then he reaches out and CUTS OFF the cop's/our ear.

The cop/camera moves around wildly.

Mr. Blonde holds the ear up to the cop/us to see.

Mr. Blonde rises, kicking the chair he was sitting on out
of the way.


23 INT./EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - HANDHELD SHOT

We follow Mr Blonde as he walks out of the warehouse...

...to his car. He opens the trunk, pulls out a large can
of gasoline.

He walks back inside the warehouse...


24 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

...carrying the can of gas.

Mr. Blonde POURS the gasoline all over the cop, who's
BEGGING him not to do this.

Mr. Blonde just sings along with Stealer's Wheel.

Mr. Blonde LIGHTS up a match and, while mouthing:

MR. BLONDE
"Clowns to the left of me,
Jokers to the right. Here I am,
stuck in the middle with you."

He moves the match up to the cop...

...When a bullet EXPLODES in Mr. Blonde's chest.

The HANDHELD camera WHIPS to the right and we see the
bloody Mr. Orange FIRING his gun.

We cut back and forth between Mr. Blonde taking BULLET
HITS and Mr. Orange emptying his weapon.

Mr. Blonde FALLS down dead.

Mr. Orange crawls to where the cop is, leaving a bloody
trail behind him.

When he reaches the cop's feet he looks up at him.

MR. ORANGE
(feebly)
What's your name?

COP
Jeffrey.

MR. ORANGE
Jeffrey what?

COP
Jeffrey Andrews.

MR. ORANGE
Listen to me, Jeffrey
Andrews. I'm a cop.

JEFFREY
I know.

MR. ORANGE
(surprised)
You do?

JEFFREY
Your name's Freddy something.

MR. ORANGE
Freddy Newendyke.

JEFFREY
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us
once, about five months ago.

MR. ORANGE
Shit. I don't remember that at
all.

JEFFREY
I do.
(pause)
How do I look?

The gun-shot Mr. Orange looks at the kid's GASHED face and
the hole in the side of his head where his ear used to be.

MR. ORANGE
I don't know what to tell you
Jeffrey.

Jeffrey starts to weep.

JEFFREY
That fucking bastard! That
fucking sick fucking bastard!

MR. ORANGE
Jeffrey, I need you to hold on.
There's officers positioned and
waiting to move in a block away.

JEFFREY
(screaming)
What the fuck are they waiting
for? That motherfucker cut off my
ear! He slashed my face! I'm
deformed!

MR. ORANGE
And I'm dying. They don't know
that. All they know is they're
not to make a move until Joe Cabot
shows up. I was sent undercover
to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they
said he's on his way. Don't pussy
out on me now, Jeffrey. We're
just gonna sit here and bleed
until Joe
Cabot sticks his fuckin head
through that door.

CUT TO:


INSERT: TITLE CARD "MR. ORANGE & MR. WHITE"


25 INT. DENNY'S - NIGHT

A tough-looking black man named HOLDAWAY, who sports a
Malcom X beard, a green Chairman Mao cap with a red star
on it, and a military flack jacket, digs into a Denny
bacon, cheese and avocado burger. He sits in a booth all
alone. He's waiting for somebody. As he waits, he
practically empties an entire bottle of ketchup on his
french fries, not by mistake either--that's just how he
likes it.

We see Mr. Orange, now known as FREDDY NEWENDYKE, wearing
a high school letterman jacket, enter the coffee shop,
spot Holdaway, and head his way. Holdaway sees Freddy bop
towards him with a wide-ass alligator grin plastered
across his face.

CAMERA DOLLIES FAST down AISLE to MEDIUM SHOT of Holdaway.
We fear Freddy OFF SCREEN.

FREDDY (O.S.)
Say "hello" to a motherfucker
who's inside. Cabot's doing a job
and take a big fat guess who he
wants on the team?

HOLDAWAY
This better not be some Freddy
joke.

LOW ANGLE

looking up at Freddy, who's standing at the table.

FREDDY
It ain't no joke, I'm in there.
I'm up his ass.

CU ON HOLDAWAY

Holdaway just looks at his pupil for a moment, then
smiles.

HOLDAWAY
Congratulations.


26 EXT. DENNY'S - NIGHT

We see through the window of the restaurant Freddy slide
into the booth across from Holdaway. Freddy's doing a lot
of talking, but we can't hear what they're saying.


27 INT. DENNY'S - NIGHT

FREEZE FRAME ON HOLDAWAY

We are frozen on a MEDIUM CU of Holdaway listening to
Freddy. We HEAR RESTAURANT NOISE and Freddy OFF SCREEN.

FREDDY (O.S.)
Nice Guy Eddie tells me Joe wants
to meet me. He says I should just
hang around my apartment and wait
for a phone call. Well after
waiting three goddamn days by the
fuckin phone, he calls me last
night and says Joe's ready, and
he'll pick me up in fifteen
minutes.

The freeze frame ENDS. Holdaway comes suddenly up to
speed and says:

HOLDAWAY
Woo all picked you up?

From here to end we cut back and forth.

FREDDY
Nice Guy. When we got to the
bar...

HOLDAWAY
...What bar?

FREDDY
The Boots and Socks in Gardena.
When we got there, I met Joe and a
guy named Mr. White. It's a phony
name. My name's Mr. Orange.

HOLDAWAY
You ever seen this motherfucker
before?

FREDDY
Who, Mr. White?

HOLDAWAY
Yeah.

FREDDY
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't
one of Cabot's soldiers either.
He's gotta be from outta town.
But Joe knows him real well.

HOLDAWAY
How can you tell?

FREDDY
The way they talk to each other.
You can tell they're buddies.

HOLDAWAY
Did the two of you talk?

FREDDY
Me and Mr. White?

HOLDAWAY
Yeah.

FREDDY
A little.

HOLDAWAY
What about?

FREDDY
The Brewers.

HOLDAWAY
The Milwaukee Brewers?

FREDDY
Yeah. They had just won the night
before, and he made a killing off
'em.

HOLDAWAY
Well, if this crook's a Brewers
fan, his ass has gotta be from
Wisconsin. And I'll bet you
everything from a diddle-eyed Joe
to a damned-if-I-know, that in
Milwaukee they got a sheet on this
Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I
want you to go through the mugs of
guys from old Milwaukee with a
history of armed robbery, and put
a name to that face.

Holdaway takes a big bite out of his burger.

HOLDAWAY
(with his mouth full)
What kinds questions did Cabot
ask?

FREDDY
Where I was from, who I knew, how
I knew Nice Guy, had I done time,
shit like that.

Holdaway's talked enough, he's eating his burger now. He
motions for Freddy to elaborate.

FREDDY
He asked me if I ever done armed
robbery before. I read him my
credits. I robbed a few gas and
sips, sold some weed, told him
recently I held the shotgun while
me and another guy pulled down a
poker game in Portland.

CAMERA MOVES from a MEDIUM on Freddy to a CU.

HOLDAWAY (O.S.)
Didja use the commode story?

FREDDY
Fuckin-A. I tell it real good,
too.


28 INT. MEN'S ROOM - L.A. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

Freddy and Holdaway at one of their many rendezvous.
Holdaway wears an extra large Lakers sweatshirt. Freddy
sits on one of the sinks, wearing his high school jacket,
looking at pieces of paper stapled together.

FREDDY
What's this?

HOLDAWAY
It's a scene. Memorize it.

FREDDY
What?

HOLDAWAY
A undercover cop has got to be
Marlon Brando. To do this job you
got to be a great actor. You got
to be naturalistic. You got to be
naturalistic as hell. If you
ain't a great actor you're a bad
actor, and bad acting is bull shit
in this job.

FREDDY
(referring to the
papers)
But what is this?

HOLDAWAY
It's a amusing anecdote about a
drug deal.

FREDDY
What?

HOLDAWAY
Something funny that happened to
you while you were doing a job.

FREDDY
I gotta memorize all this shit?

HOLDAWAY
It's like a joke. You remember
what's important, and the rest you
make your own. The only way to
make it your own is to keep sayin
it, and sayin it, and sayin it,
and sayin it, and sayin it.

FREDDY
I can do that.

HOLDAWAY
The things you gotta remember are
the details. It's the details
that sell your story. Now this
story takes place in this men's
room. So you gotta know the
details about this men's room.
You gotta know they got a blower
instead of a towel to dry your
hands. You gotta know the stalls
ain't got no doors. You gotta
know whether they got liquid or
powdered soap, whether they got
hot water or not, 'cause if you do
your job when you tell your story,
everybody should believe it. And
if you tell your story to somebody
who's actually taken a piss in
this men's room, and you get one
detail they remember right,
they'll swear by you.


29 INT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Freddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame,
rehearsing the anecdote. He's reading it pretty good, but
he's still reading it from the page, and every once in a
while he stumbles over his words.

FREDDY
...this was during the Los Angeles
marijuana drought of '86. I still
had a connection. Which was
insane, 'cause you couldn't get
weed anyfuckinwhere then. Anyway,
I had a connection with this
hippie chick up in Santa Cruz.
All and my friends knew it. And
they'd give me a call and say,
"Hey, Freddy, you buyin some, you
think you could buy me some too?"
They knew I smoked, so they'd ask
me to buy a little for them when I
was buyin. But it got to be
everytime I bought some weed, I
was buyin for four or five
different people. Finally I said,
"Fuck this shit." I'm makin this
bitch rich. She didn't have to do
jack shit, she never even had to
meet these people. I was fuckin
doin all the work. So I got
together with her and told her,
"Hey, I'm sick of this shit. I'm
comin through for everybody, and
nobody's comin through for me.
So, either I'm gonna tell all my
friends to find their own source,
or you give me a bunch of weed,
I'll sell it to them, give you the
money, minus ten percent, and I
get my pot for free." So, I did
if for awhile...

Freddy exits frame

CUT TO:


30 EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Another empty frame, except obviously outside. Freddy
enters frame from the same direction he exited in the
previous scene, finishing his sentence. When we move to a
wider shot we see Freddy performing his monolog to
Holdaway in a parking lot. Holdaway sits on the hood of
his beat-up car. Freddy paces back and forth as he
performs his story.

FREDDY
...but then that got to be a pain
in the ass. People called me on
the phone all the fuckin time. I
couldn't rent a fuckin tape
without six phone calls
interrupting me. "Hey, Freddy,
when's the next time you're gettin
some?" "Motherfucker, I'm tryin
to watch 'Lost Boys'-- when I have
some, I'll let you know." And
then these rinky-dink pot heads
come by--there's my friends and
everything, but still. I got all
my shit laid out in sixty dollar
bags. Well, they don't want sixty
dollars worth. They want ten
dollars worth. Breaking it up is
a major fuckin pain in the ass. I
don't even know how much ten
dollars worth is. "Well, fuck,
man, I don't want that much
around. If I have that much
around I'll smoke it." "Hey, if
you guys can't control your
smokin, that's not my problem.
You motherfuckers been smokin for
five years, be a adult about it."
Finally I just told my connection,
count me out. But as it turns
out, I'm the best guy she had, and
she depended alot on my business.
But I was still sick to death of
it. And she's trying to talk me
into not quitin.
Now this was a very weird
situation, 'cause I don't know if
you remember back in '86, there
was a major fuckin drought.
Nobody and anything. People were
livin on resin and smokin the wood
in their pipes for months. And
this chick had a bunch, and was
beggin me to sell it. So I told
her I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot
Man anymore. But I would take a
little bit and sell it to my
close, close, close friends. She
agreed to that, and said we'd keep
the same arrangement as before,
ten percent and free pot for me,
as long as I helped her out that
weekend. She had a brick of weed
she was sellin, and she didn't
want to go to the buy alone...

CUT TO:


31 INT. BOOTS AND SOCKS BAR - NIGHT

Freddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie and Mr. White all sit around a
table in a red-lighted smokey bar. Freddy continues his
story. The crooks are enjoying the hell out of it.

FREDDY
...Her brother usually goes with
her, but he's in county
unexpectedly.

MR. WHITE
What for?

FREDDY
Traffic tickets gone to warrant.
They stopped him for something,
found the warrants on 'im, took
'im to jail. She doesn't want to
walk around alone with all that
weed. Well, I don't wanna do
this, I have a bad feeling about
it, but she keeps askin me, keeps
askin me, finally I said okay
'cause I'm sick of listening to
it. Well, we're picking this guy
up at the train station.

JOE
You're picking the buyer up at the
train station? You're carrying
the weed on you?

FREDDY
Yeah, the guy needed it right
away. Don't ask me why. So we
get to the train station, and
we're waitin for the guy. Now I'm
carrying the weed in one of those
carry-on bags, and I gotta take a
piss. So I tell the connection
I'll be right back, I'm goin' to
the little boys room...

MEDIUM ON FREDDY

He walks through the door with a carry-on bag over his
shoulder. Once he's inside, he stops in his tracks. We
move into a CU.

FREDDY (V.O.)
...So I walk into the men's room,
and who's standing there?

FREEZE FRAME

on Freddy standing in front of six Los Angeles County
Sheriffs and one German Shepherd. All of their eyes are
on Freddy. Everyone is frozen.

FREDDY (V.O.)
...six Los Angeles County Sheriffs
and a German Shepherd.

NICE GUY EDDIE (V.O.)
They were waiting for you?

FREDDY (V.O.)
No. They were just a bunch of
cops hangin out in the men's room,
talkin. When I walked through the
door they all stopped what they
were talking about and looked at
me.


33 BACK TO BAR

ECU MR. WHITE

MR. WHITE
That's hard, man. That's a fuckin
hard situation.


34 BACK TO MEN'S ROOM

ECU GERMAN SHEPHERD

barking his head off.

FREDDY (V.O.)
The German Shepherd starts
barkin'. He's barkin' at me. I
mean it's obvious he's barkin' at
me.

We do a slow 360 around Freddy in the men's room. We can
hear the dog barking.

FREDDY (V.O.)
Every nerve ending, all of my
senses, the blood in my veins,
everything I has was screaming,
"Take off, man, just take off, get
the fuck outta there!" Panic hit
me like a bucket of water. First
there was the shock of it--BAM,
right in the face! Then I'm just
standin there drenched in panic.

SLOW MOTION

CAMERA does a PAN from face to face of the sheriffs.

FREDDY (V.O.)
And all those sheriffs are lookin
at me and they know. They can
smell it. As sure as that fuckin
dog cam, they can smell it on me.

FREEZE FRAME

Back to the same freeze frame shot of Freddy standing in
front of the sheriffs. It suddenly jerks to life, and
moves to speed. The dog is barking. Freddy moves to his
right, out of frame. We stay on the sheriffs. One
sheriff yells at the dog.

SHERIFF #1
Shut up!

The dog quiets down. Sheriff #2 continues with his story.
A couple of the sheriffs look over at Freddy off screen,
but as Sheriff #2 talks, turn their attention to him.

SHERIFF #2
So my gun's drawn, right? I got
it aimed right at him. I tell
'em, "Freeze, don't fuckin move."
And the little idiot's lookin at
me, nodding his head "Yes," sayin
"I know...I know...I know."
Meanwhile his right hand is
creepin towards his glove box. So
I scream at him, "Asshole, you
better fuckin freeze right now!"
And he's still lookin right at me,
saying
"I know...I know...I know." And
his right hand's still going for
the glove box.

The CAMERA PANS away from the sheriffs to Freddy, up
against the urinal, playing possum, pretending to piss.

SHERIFF #2 (O.S.)
I tell 'im, "Buddy, I'm gonna
shoot you in the face right now if
you don't put your hands on the
fuckin dash." And the guy's
girlfriend, a real sexy Oriental
bitch, starts screamin at him,
"Chuck, are you out of your mind?
Put your hands on the dash like
the officer said." And then like
nothing, the guy snaps out of it
and casually puts his hands on the
dash.

Freddy finishes his playing possum piss, and walks past
the sheriffs over to the sink. The CAMERA PANS with him.
A sheriff is sitting on a sink. He looks down and watches
Freddy wash his hands.

SHERIFF #1
What was he goin for?

SHERIFF #2
His registration. Stupid fuckin
citizen, doesn't have the
slightest idea how close he came
to gettin shot.

Freddy finishes washing his hands. He goes to dry them,
but there's only those hand drying machines. Freddy turns
on the drying machine. He can't hear anything the
sheriffs say now. The sound of the machine dominates the
sound track.

These following shots are SLOW MOTION.

TWO SHOT OF FREDDY AND HOLDAWAY

look at mug shot.

HOLDAWAY
Lawrence Dimick. Let's see what
we got on him.

Holdaway sits behind his desk. Freddy sits on the edge of
the desk eating a Double-Double with cheese. They look
into the CAMERA.

We hear Jodie's voice OFFSCREEN.

JODIE (OS)
Lawrence "Larry" Dimick. Also
known as Lawrence Jacobs and Alvin
"Al" Jacobs. This guy is Mr. Joe-
Armed-Robbery. He's
a pro and he makes it a habit not
to get caught.


MEDIUM SHOT OF JODIE

DOLLY slowly into C.U.

JODIE
He's only been convicted twice,
which is pretty good for somebody
living a life of crime. Once for
armed robbery, when he was twenty-
one, in Milwaukee.


C.U. FREDDY

FREDDY
What was it?


JODIE

JODIE
Payroll office at a lumber yard.
First offense - he got eighteen
months. He didn't get busted
again until he was thirty-two.
And then it was a backdoor bust.
A routine vice squad roust. They
roust this bar, out buddy Lawrence
is in there knocking down a few.
He gets picked up. He's wearing
on his person an outlaw .45
automatic, apparently his weapon
of choice. Also, on his finger is
a diamond ring from a jewelry
store robbery a year earlier. He
got two years back inside for
that.


TWO SHOT OF HOLDAWAY AND FREDDY

Freddy winces.

FREDDY
Goddamn, that's hard time.


JODIE

JODIE
So far, it's the only time he's
ever done.


CU HOLDAWAY

HOLDAWAY
Was this vice squad bullshit in
Milwaukee?


JODIE

JODIE
No. The vice squad roust was in
L.A. He's been in Los Angeles
since '77.


DOLLY BEHIND HOLDAWAY'S DESK

from left to right.

FREDDY
When did he do this time?

JODIE
Back in '83, got out late '86. I
found something else out I think
you two should be aware of.
About a year and a half ago, up in
Sacramento, an undercover cop,
John Dolenz, worked his way into a
bank job. Apparently before the
job they found out he was a cop.
Now picture this: It's Dolenz's
birthday, a bunch of cops are
waiting in his apartment for a
surprise party. The door opens,
everyone yells "Surprise!", and
standing in the doorway is Dolenz
and this other guy sticking a gun
in Dolenz's ribs. Before anybody
knows what's going on, this
stranger shoots Dolenz dead and
starts firing two .45 automatics
into the crowd.

HOLDAWAY
What happened?

The DOLLY moves behind Jodie.

JODIE
It was a mess. Cops got hit,
wives got hit, girlfriends got
hit, his dog got hit. People got
glass in their faces. Three were
killed, six were wounded.

FREDDY
They couldn't pin the killing on
one of the bank robbers?

JODIE
They tried, but they didn't have a
positive I.D. and all those guys
had alibis. Besides, we really
didn't have anything on them. We
had the testimony of a dead man
that they were talking
about committing a robbery. They
never went ahead with the bank
job.

The DOLLY completes its circle.

FREDDY
And Larry Dimick was one of the
boys?

JODIE
He was probably the one.


ON HOLDAWAY

HOLDAWAY
Just how sure are you with your
cover?

PAN to C.U. on Freddy.

FREDDY
Today they may know something,
tomorrow they may know something
else. But yesterday they didn't
know anything.

EDDIE
He'll be right down.


39 INT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

The CAMERA follows Freddy as he hops around the
apartment getting everything he needs. He puts on
his jacket and slips on some sneakers.

DOLLY fast toward the front door knob. Freddy's hand
comes into FRAME, grabs the knob, then lets go. We MOVE
UP to his face.

Fear.

FREDDY
(to himself)
Don't pussy out on me now. They
don't know. They don't know shit.
(pause)
You're not gonna get hurt. You're
fucking Baretta and they believe

you're super cool.

He exits FRAME. We stay put and hear the door open and
close OFF SCREEN.

I swear, a guy has to have rocks
in his head the size of Gibraltar

COP #2 (OS)
Yeah, gimme the bear claw.

Freddy gets into the car and it pulls into traffic.

Cop #1 starts the engine and follows.


41 INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Nice Guy Eddie is behind the wheel. Mr. Pink is
in the passenger seat. Freddy and Mr. White are in the
backseat together.

MR. PINK
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin
about, black women ain't the same
as white women.

MR. WHITE
(sarcastically)
There's a slight difference.

The car laughs.

MR. PINK
Go ahead and laugh, you know what
I mean. What a while bitch will
put up with, a black bitch won't
put up with for a minute. They
got a line, and if you cross it,
they fuck you up.

EDDIE
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on
this. I've seen it happen.

MR. WHITE
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such
a truism, how come every nigger I
know treats his woman like a piece
of shit?

MR. PINK
I'll make you a bet that those
same damn niggers who were showin
their ass in public, when their
bitches get 'em home, they chill
the fuck out.

MR. WHITE
Not these guys.

MR. PINK
Yeah, those guys too.

EDDIE
Let me tell you guys a story. In
one of daddy's clubs there was
this black cocktail waitress named
Elois.

MR. WHITE
Elois?

EDDIE
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We
called her Lady E.

MR. WHITE
Where was she from, Compton?

EDDIE
No. She was from Ladora Heights.

MR. PINK
The black Beverly Hills. I knew
this lady from Ladora Heights
once.
(in a stuck up black
female voice)
"Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's
the black Beverly Hills."
EDDIE
It's not the black Beverly Hills,
it's the black Palos Verdes.
Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a
man-eater-upper. I bet every guy
who's ever met her has jacked off
to her at least once. You know
who she looked like? Christie
Love. 'Member that TV show "Get
Christie Love"? She was a black
female cop. She always used to
say "You're under arrest, sugar."

MR. PINK
I was in the sixth grade when that
show was on. I totally dug it.
What the fuck was the name of the
chick who played Christie
Love?

EDDIE
Pam Grier.

MR. PINK
No, it wasn't Pan Grier, Pan Grier
was the other one. Pan Grier made
the movies. Christie Love was
like a Pam Grier TV show, without
Pam Grier.

MR. PINK
What the fuck was that chick's
name? Oh this is just great, I'm
totally fuckin tortured now.

EDDIE
Well, whoever she was, Elois
looked like her. So one night I
walk into the club, and no Elois.
Now the bartender was a wetback,
he was a friend of mine, his name
was Carlos.
So I asked him "Hey, Carlos,
where's Lady E tonight?" Well
apparently Lady E was married to
this real piece of dog shit. I
mean a real animal. And
apparently he would so things to
her.

FREDDY

Do things? What would he do? You
mean like beat her up?

EDDIE
Nobody knows for sure what he did.
We just know he did something.
Anyway, Elois plays it real cool.
And waits for the next time this
bag of shit gets drunk. So one
night the guy gets drunk and
passes out on the couch. So while
the guy's
inebriated, she strips him naked.
Then she takes some crazy glue and
glues his dick to his belly.

The car reacts to how horrible that would be.

EDDIE
I'm dead fuckin serious. She put
some on his dick and some on his
belly, then stuck 'em together.
The paramedics had to come and cut
it loose.

The car reacts badly.

MR. WHITE
Jesus Christ!

FREDDY
You can do some crazy things with
it.

EDDIE
I don't know what he did to her,
but she got even.

MR. WHITE
Was he all pissed off?

MR. PINK
How would you feel if you had to
do a handstand every time you took
a piss.

The car laughs.


42 EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

Nice Guy Eddie pulls up outside the warehouse.
The four men climb out of the car and follow Eddie inside.


43 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The four men enter the building.

At the other end of the warehouse, sitting in chairs, are
Mr. Blonde, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue and Joe Cabot.

We shoot this from OVERHEAD, looking down on the men.

JOE
(to everybody)
...So they're talkin about how
they get their wives off, and the
French guys says:
(in a bad French
accent)
"All I gotta do is take my pinky
and tickle my Fifi's little oo la
la and she rises a foot off the
bed."

Back to Joe.

So the dago says:


CU ON JOE

JOE
(in a good Brooklyn
accent)
"That's nothin. When I take the
tip of my tongue and wiggle it
against my Mary Louise's little
fun pimple, she rises two feet off
da bed." Then our friend from
Poland says:
(in dumb voice)
"You guys ain't no cocksmen. When
I get through fuckin my Sophie, I
wipe my dick on the curtains and
you know what? She hits the
roof!"

Joe laughs like a crazy man.

JOE
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

We hear a lot of laughing OFF SCREEN.

JOE
Ain't that a masterpiece? Stupid
fuckin Polack, wipes his dick on
the drapes.

Joe's eyes greet the new arrivals.

JOE
You're here, great!

Joe EXITS C.U.

We now have everybody from the Uncle Bob's Pancake House
scene together again. Some sit on folding chairs, some
stand. Joe sits in front of them on the edge of a table.
A blackboard with a layout of the jewelry store is off to
the right.

We do a 360 around the men.

EDDIE
We woulda gotten here sooner, but
we got backed up around La Brea
and Pico.

JOE
No hurry.
(to the boys)
All right, let's get to know one
another. With the exception of
Eddie and myself, who you already
know, you'll be using aliases.
Under no circumstances are you to
tell one another your real name or
anything else about yourself.
That includes where you're from,
your wife's name, where you
might've done time, about a bank
in St. Petersburg you might've
robbed. You guys don't say shit
about who you are, where you been
or what you've done. Only thing
you guys can talk about is what
you're going to do. This way the
only ones who know who the members
of the team are are Eddie and
myself. And that's the way I like
it. Because in the unlikely event
of one of you getting apprehended
by the cops, not that I expect
that to happen - it most
definitely should not happen - it
hasn't happened, you don't have
anything to deal with. You don't
know any names. You know my name,
you know Eddie's name. That I
don't care about. You gotta prove
it. I ain't worried. Besides,
this way you gotta trust me. I
like that. I set this up and
picked the men I wanted for it.
None of you came to me, I
approached all of you. I know
you. I know your work, I know
your reputation. I know you as
men. Except for this guy.

Joe points a finger at Freddy.

Freddy shits a brick.

JOE
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he
wouldn't be here. Okay, let me
introduce everybody to everybody.
But once again, at the risk of
being redundant, if I even think I
hear somebody telling or referring
to somebody by their Christian
name...
(Joe searches for the
right words)
...you won't want to be you.
Okay, quickly.
(pointing at the men
as he gives them a
name)
Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde,
Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr.
Pink.

MR. PINK
Why am I Mr. Pink?

JOE
Cause you're a faggot.

Everybody laughs.

MR. PINK
Why can't we pick out our own
colors?

JOE
I tried that once, it don't work.
You get four guys fighting over
who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since
nobody knows anybody else, nobody
wants to back down. So forget it,
I pick. Be thankful you're not
Mr. Yellow.

MR. BROWN
Yeah, but Mr. Brown? That's too
close to Mr. Shit.

Everybody laughs.

MR. PINK
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr.
Pussy. Tell you what, let me be
Mr. Purple. That sounds good to
me, I'm Mr. Purple.

JOE
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody
from another job's Mr. Purple.
You're Mr. Pink.

MR. WHITE
Who cares what your name is? Who
cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr.
Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...

MR. PINK
Oh that's really easy for you to
say, you're Mr. White. You gotta
cool-sounding name. So tell me,
Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink"
is no big deal, you wanna trade?

JOE
Nobody's trading with anybody!
Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin
city counsel meeting! Listen up
Mr. Pink. We got two ways here,
my way or the highway. And you
can go down either of 'em. So
what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?

MR. PINK
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin forget
it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr.
Pink, let's move on.

CAMERA leaves the team and goes to the blackboard
with the layout of the jewelry store on it.

JOE (OS)
Okay fellas, let's get into this.

CUT TO:


44 EXT. BLEACHERS - DAY

Freddy and Holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty
little league baseball field.

HOLDAWAY
Okay, we're gonna station men
across the street from Karina's
Fine Jewelry. But their orders
will be not to move in unless the
robbery gets out of control. You
gotta make sure they don't have to
move in. You're inside to make
sure that everything goes
according to Hoyle. We have men
set up a block away from the
warehouse rendezvous. They got
complete visibility of the
exterior. So as soon as Joe Cabot
shows up, we'll see it.

FREDDY
What's your visibility of the
interior?

HOLDAWAY
We can't see shit on the inside.
And we can't risk gettin any
closer for fear they'll spot us.

FREDDY
This is bullshit, Jim. I get all
the fuckin danger of having you
guys in my back pocket but none of
the safety.

HOLDAWAY
What's the matter, Newendyke? Job
too tough for ya? No one lied to
you. You always knew we'd hang
back until Joe Cabot showed up.

FREDDY
Oh this is great. You ain't
giving me no fuckin protection
whatsoever. But you are giving me
an attitude.

HOLDAWAY
Since when does an undercover cop
have protection? Freddy, you came
into this thing with your eyes
wide open, so don't start screamin
blind man now. I understand
you're nervous. I wish the
warehouse had more visible
windows, but it doesn't. We have
to make do with the cards we're
dealt.

FREDDY
I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it.
I'm just remarking on how shitty
the situation is!

HOLDAWAY
I don't mean to be harsh with ya,
but I've found tough love works
best in these situations. We have
to get Joe Cabot in the company of
the thieves and in the same
vicinity as the loot.
We don't care about these other
bastards. We're willing to offer
them good deals to testify against
Cabot.

FREDDY
Isn't this risk unorthodox?

HOLDAWAY
What?

FREDDY
Letting them go ahead with the
robbery?

HOLDAWAY
The whole idea behind this
operation is to catch Joe Cabot
red-handed. We bust these hired
hands, we ain't accomplished shit.
Letting them go through with the
heist is a risk, but Cabot's jobs
are very clean. We got people
surrounding the perimeter. We got
a guy and a gal on the inside
posing as a couple shopping for
rings. We could replace the
employees with cops, but we'd run
the risk of tipping 'em off.

FREDDY
That's out. They know the faces
of who works what shift.

HOLDAWAY
These guys are professionals.
We're professionals. It's a risk,
but I think it's a calculated
risk.


45 EXT. KARINA'S FINE JEWELRY - DAY

We see MOS SHOTS of the outside of the jewelry store.

CUSTOMERS coming and going. STORE CLERKS waiting on
customers through the windows.

While we look at this we HEAR over the soundtrack Mr.
White and Freddy talking OFF SCREEN.

MR. WHITE (VO)
Let's go over it. Where are you?

FREDDY (VO)
I stand outside and guard the
door. I don't let anybody come in
or go out.

MR. WHITE (VO)
Mr. Brown?

FREDDY (VO)
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's
parked across the street till I
give him the signal, then he pulls
up in front of the store.

MR. WHITE (VO)
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?

FREDDY (VO)
Crowd control. They handle
customers and employees in the
display area.


46 INT. MR. WHITE'S CAR (PARKED) - DAY

Mr. White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street
from the jewelry store, staking it out.

MR. WHITE
Myself and Mr. Pink?

FREDDY
You two take the manager in the
back and make him give you the
diamonds. We're there for those
stones, period. Since no display
cases are being fucked with, no
alarms should go off. We're out
of there in two minutes, not one
second longer. What if the
manager won't give up the
diamonds?

MR. WHITE
When you're dealing with a store
like this, they're insured up the
ass. They're not supposed to give
you and resistance
whatsoever. If you get a customer
or an employee who thinks he's
Charles Bronson, take the butt of
your gun and smash their nose in.
Drops 'em right to the floor.
Everyone jumps, he falls down,
screaming, blood squirts out his
nose. Freaks everybody out.
Nobody says fuckin shit after
that. You might get some bitch
talk shit to ya. But give her a
look, like you're gonna smash her
in the face next. Watch her shut
the fuck up. Now if it's a
manager, that's a different story.
The managers know better than to
fuck around. So if one's givin
you static, he probably thinks
he's a real cowboy. So what you
gotta do is break that son-of-a-
bitch in two. If you wanna know
something and he won't tell you,
cut off one of his fingers. The
little one. Then you tell 'im his
thumb's next. After that he'll
tell ya if he wears ladies
underwear. I'm hungry, let's get
a taco.

CUT TO:


47 EXT. ALLEY - DAY

It's the moment of the robbery. The alley is empty.

In the distance we hear all hell breaking loose. Guns
FIRING, people SHOUTING and SCREAMING, sirens WAILING,
glass BREAKING...

A car whips around the corner, into the alley.

The doors BURST open, Freddy and Mr. White hop out.

Freddy opens the driver's side door. A bloody SCREAMING
Mr. Brown FALLS out.

MR. BROWN
(screaming)
My eyes! My eyes! I'm blind, I'm
fucking blind!

FREDDY
You're not blind, there's just
blood in your eyes.

Mr. White loads his two .45 automatics. He RUNS to the
end of the alley just as a police car comes into SIGHT.

FIRING both .45's, Mr. White massacres everyone in the
patrol car.

Freddy, holding the dying Mr. Brown, looks on at Mr.
White's ambush in shock.

Mr. Brown lifts his head up, blood in his eyes.

MR. BROWN
Mr. Orange? You're Mr. Orange,
aren't you?

By the time Freddy turns his head back to him, Mr. Brown
is dead.

Mr. White RUNS up to Freddy.

MR. WHITE
Is he dead?

Freddy doesn't answer, he can't.

MR. WHITE
Did he did or not?

Freddy, scared.

FREDDY
I'm sorry.

MR. WHITE
What? Snap out of it!

Mr. White GRABS Freddy by the coat and YANKS him along as
he RUNS.

They EXIT the alley and FLEE down a street.

A car with a FEMALE DRIVER comes up on the two men.

Mr. White JUMPS in her path, stopping the car. He points
his jun at her.

MR. WHITE
Get us outta here!

Mr. White climbs into the backseat.

Freddy starts to climb in.

The Female driver comes up with a gun from under her seat.

MR. WHITE
The bitch's got a gun!

She SHOOTS Freddy in the stomach.

On instinct Freddy brings up his gun and SHOOTS her in the
face.


C.U. ON FREDDY

as he FALLS to the ground he realizes what's happened
to him and what he's done. SLOW MOTION.

Mr White DRAGS the dead female driver out of the car. He
SHOVES Freddy in the backseat and DRIVES away.


48 INT. GETAWAY CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Freddy holding his stomach and doubled over in pain is
CRYING.

We replay the scene between Freddy and Mr. White in the
getaway car. Except this time, we never leave Freddy.

MR. WHITE (OS)
Just hold on buddy boy.

FREDDY
I'm sorry. I can't believe she
killed me...


CUT FROM FREDDY IN THE BACKSEAT TO:


49 INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Mr. Pink is behind the wheel, Nice Guy Eddie is in the
passenger seat going through the satchel with the
diamonds. Mr. White is in the backseat. The car is
SPEEDING back to the garage.

EDDIE
(looking through the
case)
You know, all things considered,
this was pretty successful.

MR. WHITE
I don't believe you just said
that.

EDDIE
No, it was messy as hell, but do
you realize how much you got away
with? There's over two million
dollars worth of diamonds here.

MR. PINK
I love this guy.

EDDIE
Hey, what's done is done. We can
all sit around and have a big cry
about it or we can deal with the
situation at hand.

MR. WHITE
The situation as hand isn't that
fuckin satchel. You and Joe have
a responsibility to your men.

EDDIE
Hey, it's the best I could do.

MR. WHITE
The man is fucking dying.

EDDIE
And I'm telling you, Bonnie'll
take care of him.

MR. WHITE
He needs a doctor, not a fuckin
nurse.

EDDIE
Ask me how many doctors I called.
You wanna embarrass yourself, ask
me how many doctors I called.

MR. WHITE
Obviously not enough.

EDDIE
Fuck you! You gotta little black
book, then whip is out. If not,
listen how it is. I called three
doctors and couldn't get through
to shit. Now, time being a
factor, I called Bonnie. Sweet
broad, helluva broad, and a
registered nurse. Told her a
bullshit story, upside: she said
bring him to her apartment.

MR. WHITE
If he dies I'm holding you
personally responsible.

EDDIE
Fuck you buddy boy! Okay, you
wanna play that way. I am
personally leaving myself
vulnerable with this Bonnie
situation. I don't think she'll
call the cops, but I don't know
for sure. But me being too nice-
a-fuckin-guy was willin to risk
it. But no fuckin more.
(he grabs his
portable phone)
I'm callin Bonnie back and tellin
her to forget it. You take care
of your friend, you know so much
about it.

MR. PINK
Goddamnit, will you guys grow up!

EDDIE
I don't need to grow up, my
friend. I am a grown up. I'm
being responsible, I'm taking care
of business.

MR. WHITE
Cut the shit! I don't think you
called anybody except some cooze
you once fucked, who happens to
wear orthopedic shoes. And I
don't think that's good enough
care for a gut-shot man.

EDDIE
Yeah, well I don't give a flying
fuck what you think!

MR. PINK
(to Mr. White)
Look, he's not sayin this bitch is
gonna operate on him. She's gonna
give him better attention than we
can until we can get a doctor.
Nobody's forgotten about doctors.
Joe'll get one in a snap. This is
something we're doing in the
meantime. I think both of you are
actin like a couple of assholes.

EDDIE
Yeah, right. I arrange a nurse, I
leave myself wide open, and I'm an
asshole.


50 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

MEDIUM SHOT on the door. Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and
Mr. Pink walk through it. They stop in their tracks.

We see what they see. Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground,
shot full of holes. The cop slumped over in his chair, a
bloody mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding
his wound. Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the
shot.

EDDIE
What the fuck happened here?

Eddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde/Toothpick Vic.

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Orange)
What happened?

MR. ORANGE
(very weakly)
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the
cop's face, cut off his ear and
was gonna burn him alive.

EDDIE
(yelling)
Who cares what he was gonna do to
this fuckin pig?

Eddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop. The cop and
the chair tip over. Eddie stands over him and SHOOTS him
once more.

EDDIE
(to Mr. Orange)
You were saying he went crazy?
Something like that? Worse or
better?

MR. ORANGE
Look, Eddie, he was pullin a burn.
He was gonna kill the cop and me.
And when you guys walked through
the door, he was gonna blow you to
hell and make off with the
diamonds.

MR. WHITE
(to Eddie)
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya?
That sick piece of shit was a
stone cold psycho.

MR. ORANGE
(to Eddie)
You could've asked the cop, if you
didn't just kill him. He talked
about what he was going to do when
he was slicing him up.

EDDIE
I don't buy it. It doesn't make
sense.

MR. WHITE
It makes perfect fuckin sense to
me. Eddie, you didn't see how he
acted during the job, we did.

Mr. Pink walks over to the cop's body.

MR. PINK
He's right about the ear, it's
hacked off.

EDDIE
(to Mr. Orange)
Let me say this out loud, just to
get it straight in my mind.
According to you, Mr. Blonde was
gonna kill you. Then when we came
back, kill us, grab the diamonds,
and scram. That's your story?
I'm correct about that, right?

MR. ORANGE
Eddie, you can believe me or not
believe me, but it's the truth. I
swear on my mother's eternal soul
that's what happened.

The CAMERA mover into a C.U. of Nice Guy Eddie.

There's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange
has said. Finally:

EDDIE
You're a fuckin liar. Now why
don't you drop the fuckin fairy
tale and tell me what really
happened?

MR. WHITE (OS)
He told you what really happened.
You just can't deal with it.

MR. ORANGE (OS)
Okay, you're right, I'm lying.
Even though I'm fuckin dyin I'm
not above pullin a fast one. Get
rid of Blonde, we share his split
- no, scratch that, I shot him
'cause I didn't like his hair
style. I didn't like his shoes
either. If it has just been his
hair, I'd've maybe, maybe I said,
let him live. But hair and
footwear together, he's a goner.

EDDIE
The man you killed was just
released from prison. He got
caught at a company warehouse full
of hot items. He could've walked
away. All he had to do was say my
dad's name. But instead he shut
his mouth and did his time. He
did four years for us, and he did
'em like a man. And we were very
grateful. So, Mr. Orange, you're
tellin me this very good friend of
mine, who did four years for my
father, who in four years never
made a deal, no matter what they
dangled in front of him, you're
telling me that now, that now this
man is free, and we're making good
on our commitment to him, he's
just gonna decide, right out of
the fuckin blue, to rip us off?

Silence.

EDDIE
Mr. Orange, why don't you tell me
what really happened?

VOICE (OS)
Why? It'll just be more bullshit.

Eddie steps out of his C.U. and we see Joe Cabot standing
in the warehouse doorway. He walks into the room.

JOE
(pointing to Mr.
Orange)
This man set us up.

CAMERA does a 360 around the men.

EDDIE
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know
what's happening.

JOE
That's okay, Eddie, I do.

MR. WHITE
(to Joe)
What the fuck are you talking
about?

JOE
(pointing to Mr.
Orange)
That piece of shit. Workin with
the cops.

MR. WHITE MR. PINK EDDIE
What?

JOE
I said this lump of shit is workin
with the LAPD.


MR. ORANGE'S POV

Looking up from the floor at everybody.

Joe looks down at Mr. Orange.

JOE
Aren't you?

MR. ORANGE (OS)
I don't have the slightest fuckin
idea what you're talkin about.

MR. WHITE
(very calmly to Joe)
Joe, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.

JOE
Like hell I am.

MR. WHITE
(very calmly)
Joe, trust me on this, you've made
a mistake. He's a good kid. I
understand you're hot, you're
super-fuckin pissed. We're all
real emotional. But you're
barking up the wrong tree. I know
this man, and he wouldn't do that.

JOE
You don't know jack shit. I do.
This rotten bastard tipped off the
cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr.
Blue killed.

MR. PINK
Mr. Blue's dead?

JOE
Dead as Dillinger.

EDDIE
The motherfucker killed Vic.

MR. WHITE
How do you know all this?

JOE
He was the only one I wasn't a
hundred percent on. I should have
my fucking head examined for goin
forward when I wasn't a hundred
percent. But he seemed like a
good kid, and I was impatient and
greedy and all the things that
fuck you up.

MR. WHITE
(screaming)
That's your proof?

JOE
You don't need proof when you got
instinct. I ignored it before,
but not no more.

He WHIPS out a revolver and aims it at Mr. Orange.

Mr. White brings his .45 up at Joe.

Eddie and Mr. Pink are shook awake by the flash of
firearms.

Eddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr. White.

EDDIE
Have you lost your fucking mind?
Put your gun down!

Mr. Pink fades into the B.G., wanting no part of this.

MR. WHITE
Joe, you're making a terrible
mistake I can't let you make.

EDDIE
Stop pointing your fuckin gun at
daddy!

Joe, never taking his eyes off Mr. Orange.

JOE
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry
have been friends a long time, he
ain't gonna shoot. We like each
other too much.

MR. WHITE
Joe, if you kill that man, you die
next. Repeat, if you kill that
man, you die next!

We get many different angles of the Mexican standoff.


MEDIUMS ON EVERYBODY

Mr. Orange holding his belly, looking from left to right.

Joe pointing down on Mr. Orange. Not taking his eyes off
him.

Mr. White pointing at Joe, looking like he's ready to
start firing any minute.

Eddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on Mr.
White.

Mr. Pink walking backwards away from the action.

Nobody says nothing.


FOUR SHOT

of guys ready for violence. Mr. Pink in the B.G.

MR. PINK
C'mon, guys, nobody wants this.
We're supposed to me fuckin
professionals!

Joe raises his head to Mr. White.

JOE
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.

MR. WHITE
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do
this!

JOE
Larry, I'm askin you to trust me
on this.

MR. WHITE
Don't ask me that.

JOE
I'm not askin, I'm betting.

Joe's eyes go back to Mr. Orange.

EDDIE
Daddy, don't!

Joe FIRES three times, HITTING Mr. Orange with every one.

Mr. White SHOOTS Joe twice in the face. Joe brings his
hands up to his face, screaming, and falls to the ground.

Eddie FIRES at Mr. White, HITTING him three times in the
chest.

Mr. White brings his gun around on Eddie and SHOOTS him.

The two men FALL to their knees, FIRING at each other.

Eddie COLLAPSES, dead.

Joe's dead.

Mr. Orange lies perfectly still, except for his chest
heaving. The only SOUND we hear is his loud breathing.

Mr. White is SHOT full of holes, but still on his knees,
not moving.

Mr. Pink is standing motionless. Finally he grabs the
satchel of diamonds and RUNS out the door.

We hear outside a CAR START. Then the SOUND of a BULLHORN
yells out:

POLICE FORCE (OS)
Freeze! Get out of the car and lie
face down on the ground!

MR. PINK (OS)
Don't shoot!

We now hear SIRENS, the SOUNDS of more CARS DRIVING UP,
MEN RUNNING to the warehouse.

While all this noise is going on, Mr. White tries to stand
but FALLS DOWN. He somehow makes it to where Mr. Orange
lies.

He lifts Mr. Orange's head, cradling it in his lap and
stroking his brow.

MR. WHITE
(with much effort)
Sorry, kid. Looks like we're
gonna do a little time.

Mr. Orange looks up at him and, with even more of an
effort:

MR. ORANGE
I'm a cop.

Mr. White doesn't say anything, he keeps stroking Orange's
brow.

MR. ORANGE
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

Mr. White lifts his .45 and places the barrel between Mr.
Orange's eyes.

The CAMERA MOVES into an EXTREME C.U. of Mr White.

The SOUNDS of outside STORM inside. We don't see
anything, but we HEAR a bunch of shotguns COCKING.

POLICE FORCE (OS)
Freeze, motherfucker! Drop your
fucking gun!

Mr White looks up at them, smiles, PULLS the trigger.

BANG

We hear a BURST of SHOTGUN FIRE.

Mr. White is BLOWN out of frame, leaving it empty.



DJANGO UNCHAINED



Written by

Quentin Tarantino





I

EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - BROILING HOT DAY

As the film's OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE plays, complete with its own
SPAGHETTI WESTERN THEME SONG, we see SEVEN shirtless and shoeless
BLACK MALE SLAVES connected together with LEG IRONS, being run,
by TWO: WHITE MALE HILLBILLIES on HORSEBACK.

The location is somewhere in Texas. The Black Men (ROY, BIG SID,
BENJAMIN, DJANGO, PUDGY RALPH, FRANKLYN, and BLUEBERRY) are slaves just
recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville
Mississippi. The White Hillbillies are two Slave Traders called,
The SPECK BROTHERS (ACE and DICKY).

One of the seven slaves is our hero DJANGO... . he's fourth in the leg
iron line. We may or may not notice a tiny small "r" burned into his
cheek ("r" for runaway), but we can't help but notice his back which
has been SLASHED TO RIBBONS by Bull Whip Beatings.

As the Operatic Opening Theme Song plays, we see a MONTAGE of misery
and pain, as Django and the Other Men are walked through blistering
sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip. Bare feet
step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles. Leg Irons take the
skin off ankles.

AS The CREDITS play, DJANGO has a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK.
Now Spaghetti Western Flashbacks are never pretty, it's usually the
time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most
painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters
from his past. In this instance we see Django in a SLAVE PEN at the
Greenville Auction.

DJANGO
Amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of the
cell door, his wife BROOMHILDA being led to the auction block.

He fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the distance,
he can see Broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the distance he
hears the Auctioneer yell; "Sold." Then she's taken away to whereabouts
unknown, never to be seen again.

As the sun continues to beat down on Django's head, he remembers;

DJANGO in the SLAVE PEN
with what seems like a one hundred and fifty Slaves in a cell designed
for forty.

WHITE MEN yank him out. of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and lead him
down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area
circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the
structure.

The ground floor is covered by the BIG MONEY BUYERS who stand in front
of the auction block.









2

DJANGO
is moved into a line of SLAVES (The Black Men), and their MASTERS
(their White Owners), and their SELLERS (the White Man actually doing
the sales pitch on the auction block), as they wait for their turn on
the block.
A SLAVE (ROBBIE), stand on the auction block in view of the room full
of Buyers, The SELLER sells, and the OWNERS stand off to the side.

DJANGO
takes in the environment around him. Django has never cared for white
folks, but these white folks are in particularly ugly.

It's DJANGO's turn ON THE AUCTION BLOCK
as the THEME SONG wails its tragic crescendo, Django is brought up on
the auction block. He.looks down at all the WHITE PEOPLE who want to
buy Niggers, who look up to him.
His heart fills with poison.

BACK TO DJANGO
walking in Leg Irons with his six Other Companions, walking across the
blistering Texas panhandle... .remembering.. .thinking. - .hating.

THE OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE
end.


/--" EXT - WOODS -- NIGHT

It's night time and The Speck Brothers, astride HORSES, keep pushing
their black skinned cargo forward.
It's a very pitch black night, with only a few stars in the.sky to
create a little top light. It's so dark, the Slavers use the creek.bed
to keep from getting lost. Both Speck Brothers carry a lantern up on
their horse, as. does Roy, the Slave in lead position on the chain gang.
It's also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven slaves,
two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air. In fact the
seven chained together Slaves, with the lead one holding a lantern, and
all of them chugging out smoky breath, and. slightly moving in unison,
resemble a human locomotive.
The Slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs, both Speck
Brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings, and white
fur collars.

WHEN...
.A SOUND and a SMALL LIGHT appears ahead of them on the road. This
makes the Slave Traders stop their human live stock, and ready their
rifles for possible trouble.

A BLACK HORSE
carrying a dressed in grey Rider, CLIP-CLOPS from the background to the
foreground, illuminated by a glowing lantern that the Rider carries.

THE RIDER
appears to be a tenderfoot, due to his style of dress. A long grey
winter'coat, over a grey three piece business suit, and a grey bowler
hat on his head.

DICKY SPECK
Who's that stumblin around in the dark?
State your business, or prepare to get
winged!

THE RIDER
Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no
harm. I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
The Rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front
of the two Slavers, and their Slaves, lifting the lantern up to his
face. He speaks with a slight German accent.

THE RIDER
(to the Slavers)
Good cold evening gentlemen.
(to the shivering Slaves)
Good evening-I'm looking for a pair of
slave traders that go by the'name of
The Speck Brothers. Might that be you?

ACE SPECK
Who wants to. know?

THE RIDER
I do. I'm Dr. King Schultz, and this
is my horse, Fritz.
Fritz, does a little bow with his head, a neat trick the doctor taught
him.

DICKY SPECK
You a doctor?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Affirmative.

DICKY SPECK
What kinda doctor?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Dentist. Are you The Speck Brothers, and did you
purchase those men at The Greenville.Slave Auction?

ACE SPECK
So what?









LE
Dr.SCHULTZ
So, I wish to parley with you.

ACE SPECK
Speak English!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, I'm sorry. Please forgive me, it is a
second language. Amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe, is a specimen
I'm keen to acquire.
(to the slaves)
Hello you poor devils. Is there one among
you, who was formerly a resident of
The Carrucan Plantation?
Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second
half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness. In the darkness a
VOICE rings out;

DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.
Dr.Schultz moves Fritz forward towards the darkness, raises his
lantern, illuminating our hero Django.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid! And what's your name young, man?

DJANGO
Django.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Wunderbar! You're exactly the one I'm looking
for. So tell me Django - by the way that's a
amazing name - during your time at the
Carrucan Plantation, did you come to know
three overseers by the name of The Brittle
Brothers?
Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.Schultz is delighted.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Big John, Ellis, and little brother Raj?

DJANGO
Dem da Brittle Brothers.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So Django, do you think you could recognize -
ï¿½. The Speck Brothers have been watching this tenderfoot engage their
Slave in polite conversation.. .with a touch of disbelief.









ACE SPECK
Hey, stop talkin' to him like that!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Like what?

ACE SPEC
Like that!
Dr.SCHULTZ
My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain

ACE SPECK
Speak English, goddamit!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Everybody calm down! I'm simply a customer
trying to conduct a transaction.

ACE SPECK
I don't care, no sale. Now off wit ya!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Don't be ridiculous, of course they're for
sale.
Ace raises his rifle towards the German.

ACE SPECK
Move it!
Ace cocks back the rifle hammer.
Dr.SCHULTZ
My good man, did you simply get carried away
with your dramatic gesture, or are you
pointing that weapon at me with lethal
intention...?

ACE SPECK
Last chance, fancy pants
Dr.SCHULTZ
- Very well -
The doctor, throws his lantern to the ground, enveloping him in
darkness.
The next FLASH OF LIGHT we see is the good doctors PISTOL out of his
holster, and FIRING point blank into Ace Specks face...
.BLOWING the dumber dumb brother off his horse, dead in the dirt.








Before Dicky can maneuver either his rifle or his horse in the Germans
direction...

BAM...
Dr.SCHULTZ SHOOTS his HORSE in the head...
.The Steed goes down taking Dicky with him...
When the dead weight horse lands on Dicky's slightly twisted leg, we
hear TWO DISTINCT CRACKING SOUNDS.:..
Dicky lets out a bitch like scream.
The Slaves watch all this. They've never seen a white man kill another
white man before.
Dicky is pinned down under his ole paint.
Django watches in the dark, the German climb down off his horse,
pick up Ace's discarded lantern, and walk over to the remaining Speck.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Sorry about putting a bullet in your beast.
But I didn't want you to do anything rash
before you had a moment to come to your senses.
Dr.Sch.ultz LIGHTS the lantern, illuminating himself, as he stands over
Dicky's body.

DICKY SPECK
You goddamn son of a bitch, you killed Ace!
Dr.SCHULTZ.
I only shot your brother, once he threatened
to shoot me. And I do believe I have ...

(COUNTING OUT

THE SLAVES)
.one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven witnesses who can attest to that fact.

DICKY SPECK
My damn legs busted!
Dr.SCHULTZ
No doubt. Now, if you can keep your
caterwauling down to a minimum, I'd like
to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.

(TO DJANGO)
As I was saying, if you were to see
the Brittle Brothers again, would you
recognize them?

DJANGO
Yes.








Dr.SCHULTZ
Now I'm sure. to you, all unshaven white men
look alike. So Django, in a crowd of
unshaven white men, can you honestly
and positively point out The Brittle Brothers?

DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
We're in his little shack at the Carrucan Plantation. It's PISSING RAIN
outside. Django is making love to his wife Broomhilda, when she stops
letting out a shout. The three overseers known as THE BRITTLE BROTHERS
are outside peeking in through the window. They BURST in through the
front door. Soaked to the bone, they rodeo bull their way into the
shack, and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement.
As Django and Broomhilda are forced to copulate, they run their wet
white hands down her chocolate leg.. .they fondle his ass.. .they squeeze
her tit. . .they bring a belt across Django's backside to make him fuck
faster. . .then they yank him off, as BIG JOHN climbs on top of
Broomhilda..the other Brittle brothers whip Django with their belts,
and make him sit in the corner, while they finish with his wife.

BACK TO DJANGO

DJANGO
I can point 'em out.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Sold American! So Mr.Speck, how much for
Django?

DICKY SPECK
I'm gonna lose this leg!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, unless you find a talented physician
very quickly, I'm afraid that will be the.
end result. But back to business, how much
do you want for Django?

DICKY SPECK
You go to hell!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Don't be silly. How much for Django?

DICKY SPECK
800 dollars!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh come now, I may not have the experience in
the slave trade that you and your family does,
but neither was I born yesterday.

The. good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket.
Dr.SCHULTZ
In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked
up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says
that the going rate for African flesh'
- in particularly a field nigger -_is sixty
to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as
Django is, technically, he is a field. nigger.
Which according to"this pamphlet here - and
why would they lie - puts his price at
eighty dollars. So in light of that, how
bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for
young Django here.
Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a
one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And since your late brother. won't be using
it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag.
He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on
Dicky's body. He bends down and, puts the paper money-.in the saddle bags
on Dicky's dead horse. With.his hands in there, he roots around and
finds the keys to-the leg irons. He unlocks Django's leg irons.
Django is free.
Dr.SCHULTZ
There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good
rubbing, then get up on that horse.
Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter
coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
Django removes the coat from the dead slaver. Puts on the warm jacket
over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse.
Dr.Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a
bill of sale. Do you have one?
Dicky just curses him.
He says, removing a notebook from his pocket;
Dr.SCHULTZ
I thought not. No worries, I come prepared.
(as he writes)
This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
(he stops, then
says to Django)
Django is spelled with a silent "D",
is it not?









9

DJANGO
Huh?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Why not..
He writes it in his book with a silent "D", then stops to admire the
way it looks.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, that does add a little character.
The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down
under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen.
Dr.SCHULTZ
If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make your
mark here.
The. Hillbilly spits in the German gentleman's face. The good doctor
wipes his face with a handkerchief. Then takes out a pocket knife.
And whispers something that can't be heard in the slavers ear.
He signs the bill of sale.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Speck, I would like to say it was a
pleasure doing business with you, but your
customer service leaves a lot to be desired.
The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz, and looks to the six Slaves, in
leg irons.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Now as to you poor devils.
He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So as I.see it, when it comes to the subject
of what to do next, you gentlemen have two
choices. One, once I'm gone, you lift that
beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him
to the nearest town. Which would be at least
thirty-seven miles back the way you came.
Or ...
.Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that
rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep, and make your way
to a more enlightened area of the country.
The choice is yours.
He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds;









0
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, and on the off chance that there's
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,
the North Star is THAT ONE. Tata.
He looks to Django, who doesn't know how to start his horse.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Just give him a little kick.
Django does, and the horse responds by moving.
Dr.SCHULTZ
See, it's not so difficult.

EXT - MORNING TEXAS LANDSCAPE - SUNRISE
The DAWN BREAKS on a western landscape. The two men ride their horses
silently, horse hooves CLIP-CLOPPING among the rocks. Django wears
Specks winter coat, with one of Dr.Schultz's white button down dress
shirts underneath it. As they ride through the picturesque scene...
Dr.Schultz breaks the silence.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So, Django, what do you intend to name him?

DJANGO
Who?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Your horse?

DJANGO
What horse?
Dr.SCHULTZ'
The horse you're riding.

DJANGO
This ain't my horse.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes it is.

DJANGO
No it ain't, it's your horse. I'm just riding
it.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, technically, yes - Wait a minute -
technically not. If it's my horse, I can
give it to you, and as of now, I'm doing such.
Django, you're now the proud owner of a horse,
congratulations.









/1

DJANGO
I can't feed no horse. I can't put no horse
up in no stable.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(FRUSTRATED)
Don't worry about all that!
They ride a bit longer in silence.. .the good doctor composes himself...
then says with a smile;
Dr.SCHULTZ
So... . now that that's settled... . what do you
intend to name it? Half the fun of having
a horse is choosing his name. For instance
my steed is named Fritz. He's stubborn,
ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but I
couldn't do without him.
(he pats Fritz's neck)
Anyway, the name of one's steed, isn't
something one does lightly. So once you've
thought about it for awhile -

DJANGO
- Tony.
Dr.SCHULTZ
- Tony what?

DJANGO
- I dunno, Tony the horse.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, you mean you want to name your horse
Tony?

DJANGO
Yeah. That's what you jus' asked me, right?
Dr.SCHULTZ
When you're right you're right, indeed I did.
Why Tony?

DJANGO
I gotta tell ya? You didn't tell me I gotta
tell ya.
As they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a
western town. They pass by a sign that says; "WELCOME TO DAUGHTREY,

TEXAS"









/Z
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well I'm naturally curious, of course, but
there's no reason you MUST tell me. In fact
an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to
any steed. And I do believe Tony wears it
well. Good job Django, well done.

EXT - THE WESTERN TOWN OF DAUGHTREY - MORNING
As the citizens of Daughtrey wake up, Django and Dr.Schultz ride Fritz
and Tony through the main street of town..Daughtrey looks like a
million western towns we've seen before in movies. But to the
TOWNSPEOPLE of Daughtrey, Django and the German don't look like a
million other visitors.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What's everybody staring at?

DJANGO
They never seen a nigger on a horse before.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What's this bizarre obsession they have
with. you not riding horses?

DJANGO
You askin' me?
Dr.Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts. Django has
a little trouble both stopping Tony and getting off him, but it gets
done. Dr.Schultz keeps bombarding The Slave with questions.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So what other archaic rituals are you people
verboten to take part in?
As per usual with this white man, Django thinks; "What"?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm just trying to get a clear idea on what
you can do, and what you can't do, and if
you can't do it, why can't you do it?
Like for instance, what if we were to walk
in this saloon here, sit down at a table,
order a drink, and drink it?
Would the authorities frown on that?

DJANGO
Hell yeah, they gonna frown.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What part would they find the most offensive?









13

DJANGO
All of it. I can't be walkin' in no saloon.
I can't be sittin' my ass on no chair,
at no table. I can't be drinkin' no drink.
And I definitely can't be sharin' no drink,
with no white man, in public.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So if you and I did those things, that would
be considered enough of a infraction to make
the saloon keeper go get the sheriff?

DJANGO
You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff.
The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well in that case Django, after you.

DJANGO
Whoa - I ain't funnin, I can't go in there.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django you're going to have to learn to trust
me, and as the man said; "There's no time
like the,present."
He takes Django by the arm and leads him into the entryway of the
establishment.

INT - SALOON - MORNING
The nervous black slave and the confident German'dentist walk into the
saloon.
The SALOON KEEPER (PETE) is high up on a chair placed high up on a
table, to change a candle in the saloons chandelier. His back is turned
away from the two patrons.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good morning inn keeper, two beers for two
weary travelers.

SALOON KEEPER
It',s still pretty early, we won't be open
for about a hour. But by then we'll be
servin' breakfast -
He turns around and sees them.

SALOON KEEPER
Whoa! What the hell you think you doin' boy,
get that nigger outta here.









IT

TIME CUT

EXT - SALOON - MORNING
It's about five minutes later, and the Saloon Keeper comes running out
of the bar to get the Sheriff.
When Dr.Schultz, sitting at a table with the young Django, calls;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Inn keeper! Remember, get the sheriff, not
the marshall. This wouldn't be the marshalls
jurisdiction.'This is just a infraction,
on what I assume is a simple county ordinance,
and that would fall under the domain of the
Sheriff.
The Saloon Keeper runs away.
The two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon.
Dr.SCHULTZ
It looks like we must act as our own bartender.
The German stands up, and walks-behind the bar, and pours two beer's
from the tap into mugs. Django remains seated, and after a beat, asks;

DJANGO
What kinda dentist are you?
This makes the doctor laugh, as he pours the beer's.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I haven't practiced dentistry in five years -
Not to say once I know you better, I wouldn't
like to get a look at that mouth - I'm sure
it's a disaster - But these days I practice
a new profession ... . Bounty Hunter.
This gets no reaction from Django.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is?
The Black Man shakes his head, no.
As the good doctor, walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer,

HE EXPLAINS;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well the way the slave trade deals in
human lives for cash, a bounty hunter,
deals in corpses.









15
Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
The state places a bounty on a man's head.
I track that man, I find that man, I kill
that man. After I've killed him, I transport
that man's corpse back to the authorities -
and sometimes that's easier said then done.
I show that corpse to the authorities -
proving, yes indeed, I have truly killed him
- At which point, the authorities pay me
the bounty.
(lifting his beer)
Cheers.
The two men touch glasses, and take a drink.

DJANGO
What's a bounty?
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's like a reward.

DJANGO
You kill people and they give you a reward?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Certain people, yes.

DJANGO
White people?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mostly. A few Mexicans. Couple Chinamen.

DJANGO
Bad people?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Badder they are, bigger the reward.
Which brings me to you, and I must admit
I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes
to you. On one hand, I despise slavery.
On the other hand, I need your help,
and if you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better. So for the time being,
I'm going to make this slave malarkey
work to my benefit.

(BEAT)
Still... . having said that, .I feel guilty.
So... I'd like the two of us to enter into
an agreement. I'm looking for The Brittle Brothers,
however in this endeavor I'm at a slight
disadvantage, in so far as, I don't know
what they look like. But you do... .dont'cha?

ï¿½. DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
Django, back at The Carrucan Plantation, held down by Roger and Ellis
Brittle, as Big John BURNS the "r" into his cheek with a BRANDING IRON.

BACK TO DJANGO

DJANGO
I know what they look like, all right.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good. So, here's my agreement. You travel
with me till we find them -

DJANGO
- Where we goin'?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I hear at least two of them are overseeing
up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.
That means we visit every plantation in
Gatlinburg till we find them. And when we
find them, you point them out, and I kill
them. You do that, I agree to give you
your freedom... . twenty-five dollars per
Brittle brother - that's seventy-five
dollars... . your horse, Tony even though
I've already gave him to you -- but once the
final Brittle brother lies dead in the
dust, I'll buy you a new saddle, and a
new suit of clothes, handsome cowboy hat
included.
Dr.Schultz's eyes go to the saloon window.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And as if on cue... . here comes the sheriff.

EXT - SALOON - MORNING
We see the sheriff, BILL SHARP, walk towards the saloon cradling a
Winchester. Some TOWNSPEOPLE (like the Saloon Keeper) stand around to
watch. A. YOUNG BOY leads a herd of BABY GOATS through town.
Sheriff Sharp stands in the middle of the street.

SHERIFF SHARP
Okay boys, fun's over, come on out.
Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch.
As they do, The Sheriff says;









1 2

SHERIFF SHARP
Now why y'all wanna come into my town,
start trouble, and scare all these nice
people? You ain't got nothin' better to
do, then to come into Bill Sharps town
and show your ass -
From his top step on the porch, Dr. King Schultz extends his hand
toward the sheriff, as if to shake it... :.

.THEN...
A SMALL DERRINGER - POPS into Schultz's hand from a metal sliding
apparatus concealed under his jacket sleeve. Once in hand, the dentist
FIRES one tiny bullet into the belly of Bill Sharp.
The tiny gun makes a tiny POP sound.
The shocked Bill Sharp lets out a ugly groan, and doubles over in the
dirt.
The TOWNSPEOPLE are startled.
As is Django.
As Schultz walks down the porch steps, to the fallen sheriff, reloading
his tiny pop shooter, a PEDESTRIAN yells out;

PEDESTRIAN
What did you jus' do to our sheriff?
Dr.Schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law man's
skull, killing him dead.
In the background, ONE WOMAN faints. The Boy and his Goats scatter.
Dr.Schultz looks over at the Saloon Keeper, across the street.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Now you can go get the marshall.

TIME CUT

EXT - DAUGHTREY MAIN STREET - DAY
U.S.MARSHALL GILL TATUM snaps the MENFOLK OF Daughtrey to attention.

MARSHALL TATUM
Move that buckboard over there long ways
across the street from the saloon. And I
want six men and six Winchesters behind it.
And I want two men with two rifles on this
roof, and two men with two rifles on that
roof, with all barrels pointed at that
front door. And somebody git poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.









LP
Cowboys with rifles climb up stairs to take position on the roof of the
building across the street from the saloon.
The Marshall directs the buckboard being moved into place.
The last SNIPER on the rooftop takes his position.

WHEN...

COMING FROM THE SALOON... . PIANO MUSIC ...

INT - SALOON - DAY
Dr.Schultz sits behind the piano playing a catchy little saloon number.
He seems skilled enough to be a professional western saloon piano
player. A terrified Django, who's sure his new master is a lunatic
who's going to get them both killed, peeks out the closed curtains
on the window.
Dr.Schultz's suit coat sits draped over a chair. All of his weapons,
including his metal sliding rail Derringer contraption, lie on a table.
He plays piano in his button down dress shirt and gray suit vest.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What are they doing?

DJANGO
I think they wonderin' why you playin'
the piana'.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good.

(PAUSE)
But what are they doing?

DJANGO
A buncha white folks brought a buckboard
around out front, now they hidin' behind it
with guns. And a buncha other white folks
are up on the roof, with rifles pointed
down here.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Damn, they got that organized fast. Is the
marshall out there?

DJANGO
If the one I think is the.marshall is the
marshall, he's out there.

Dr.SCHULTZ
What makes you think he's the marshall?

DJANGO
Cause he's the one ready to say somethin'.

MARSHALL'S VOICE
You in the saloon!
Dr.Schultz stops playing the piano.

MARSHALL'S VOICE
We got eleven Winchesters on every way
outta that buildin'! You got once chance
git outta this alive! You and your nigger
come out right now with your hands over
your head, and I mean, right now!
Dr.SCHULTZ
First things first! Is this the marshall
I have the pleasure of addressing?

MARSHALL TATUM
Yes it is, this is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Wunderbar! So marshall, I have relieved
myself of all weapons, and just as you
have instructed, I'm ready to step outside
with my hands raised above my head.
I trust as a representative of the
criminal justice system of The United
States of America, I shant be shot down
in the street, by either you or your deputies,
before I've had my day in court.

MARSHALL TATUM
You mean like you did our sheriff? Shot
'em down like a dog in the street!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, that's exactly what I mean! Do I
have your word as a lawman not to shoot
me down like a dog in the street?

MARSHALL TATUM
Well, as much as we'd all enjoy seein'
somethin' like that, ain't nobody gonna
cheat the hangman in my town!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Fair enough marshall, here we.come.!








Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO DJANGO)
They're a little tense out there. So don't
make any quick movements, and let me do
the talking.
Django looks at him like, "as if..."

EXT - SALOON/MAIN STREET - DAY
A lot of guns are trained on the front door of the saloon.
Outside of range, the WHOLE TOWN watches the stand off.
The saloon doors open, and Dr.Schultz and Django, hands raised, step
outside.

MARSHALL TATUM
You unarmed?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes indeed we are. Marshall Tatum, may I
address you, your deputies, and apparently
the entire town of Daughtrey, as to the
incident that just occurred?

MARSHALL TATUM
Go on!
Dr.SCHULTZ
My name is Dr.King Schultz. And like
yourself, marshall, I am a servant of the
court. The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit
to elect as their sheriff, who went by
the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a
wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck,
with a price on his head of two hundred
dollars. That's two hundred dollars, dead
or alive.

MARSHALL TATUM
The hell you say!
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'.m aware this is probably disconcerting
news. But I'm willing to wager this man
was elected sheriff sometime in the last
two years. I know this because. three years
ago he was rustling cattle from,
The B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company of
Lubbock Texas.









Z/
Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
In my possession. is a warrant made out by
circuit court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk
of Austin Texas. You are encouraged to wire him.
He will back up who I am, and who your
dear departed sheriff was.
The Menfolk of the town with rifles, begin trading looks. Then
Dr.Schultz delivers the coup de grace.
Dr.SCHULTZ
In other words marshall, you owe me
two hundred dollars.

CUT TO

EXT - TENNESSEE COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
Django and Dr.Schultz, who by now have ridden quite a few miles
together, ride their horses in the Tennessee countryside, on the way to
Gatlinburg. Dr.Schultz is dressed in one of his nearly identical grey
business suits, and Django is still dressed in his slave pants,
Schultz's button down dress shirt, and Ace Speck's winter coat.
Somewhere along the way a pair of shoes have appeared on'his feet.
Dr.SCHULTZ
One needs a plan, son. These are brutal
times. A man who survives, is a man with
a plan. A man who thrives, is a man with
a good plan. So, having said that, what's
your plan, young Django?

DJANGO
What'cha mean?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, after this Brittle business is behind
us, you'll be a free man, with a horse, and
seventy five dollars in your back pocket.
What's your plan after that?

DJANGO
Find my wife, and buy her freedom.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django, I had no idea you were a married man.
Do most slaves take the institution of
matrimony seriously?

DJANGO
Huh?









ZZ
Dr.SCHULTZ
Do slaves believe in marriage'?

DJANGO
Me and my wife do.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Where is she now?

DJANGO
I dunno. They put us in different boxcars,
and sent U.S to The Greenville Slave Auction.
She got sold two days 'fore me.
But I don't know who to.
Dr.Schultz takes out a long stick of beef jerky.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Care for some jerky?

DJANGO
Sure.
Dr.Schultz rips him off a piece. Django chews on it. As he chews,

SCHULTZ SAYS;
Dr.SCHULTZ
So your plan is to trackdowri your wife, and
purchase her.freedom? Only you don't know
where she is?
A chewing Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.Schultz, takes a big bite of jerky, chews for a "moment contemplating
the dilemma, then pronounces;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well that shouldn't be all that difficult.
So how long ago did all this happen?

DJANGO
A few months ago.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Three or four?

DJANGO
Three.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So shecamefrom the Carrucan Plantation,
and shewassold at The Greenville Slave
Auctiontosome :unknown customer three
monthsago?
Django nods his head, yes.









Z3
Dr.SCHULTZ
The bad part about slavery being a business,
is it's immoral. The good part about it being
a business is, they keep records. Somewhere
in Greenville there's a book with your wife's
name in it, and the name of the customer who
bought her, and more then likely their address.
But then Schultz seems to get second thoughts.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Still, seventy-five dollars in your back
pocket is a pretty nice grub steak, but it's
not going to get you very far in Greenville.
Not to mention a slave auction town in
Mississippi isn't the safest place you could
visit. Free or not.

DJANGO
I'll have my freedom papers.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes you will. But say you show them to some
rascals, and they take them from you and
tear them up?

DJANGO
They could do that?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm not saying they would, but they could.

DJANGO
They do that I'll kill 'em.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Great! Now you get hung for killin' a white
man. The point being is the place,is just
too dangerous for you.

DJANGO
Well I gotta go, when do I go?
Dr.SCHULTZ
When you get more dangerous.

EXT - CHATTANOOGA - DAY
Muddy and wet big city Chattanooga. We're in the back of a STORE that.
sells SERVANT/HOUSE NIGGER UNIFORMS. Django comes bursting out of the
stores back door. He's very distressed. One glance at the outfit he's
wearing explains the distress.









Z

DJANGO
is dressed in a powder blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, that
wouldn't be out of place in the court of Marie Antoinette at
Versailles.
Dr.Schultz comes trailing after him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django, you have to, it's part of "The Act".
You're playing a character. Your character
is The Valet. This is what The Valet wears.
Remember what I told you. During the act,
you can never break character.

CUT TO

EXT - BENNETT MANOR- DAY
We see Dr. Schultz, riding slightly in front of Django, dressed in his
blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, as they enter the property of
BENNETT MANOR, a plantation in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Django leads a
riderless horse, behind him and Tony.
As the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front
steps of Bennett Manor, alongside the cotton fields, all the SLAVES
stop picking cotton, and straighten their bent backs up to stare in
wonder at this sight.
The patriarch of Bennett Manor, SPENCER "BIG DADDY" BENNETT, dressed in
a fancy leisure suit of the day, emerges from the double doors of the
mansion, and stands on the top steps, hands on hips, watching the white
man and black man move from the background to the foreground.
While there are plenty BLACK MALES out in the cotton fields, the
majority of the slave population of Bennett Manor is pretty.BLACK
FEMALES, fourteen to twenty-four, referred to as, "PONY'S".
The biggest money making crop of this farm, after cotton.
As Dr.Schultz and fancy pants Django, bring Fritz and Tony to a stop
in front of Bennett Manor, they've drawn quite a crowd of SLAVES,
BENNETT FAMILY MEMBERS, and WHITE WORKERS (OVERSEER'S).
Spencer Bennett keeps on the top step so he won't be forced to look up
at the darkee on the horse.

SPENCER BENNETT
It's against the law for niggers to ride
horses in this territory.
Dr.SCHULTZ
This is my valet, and my valet doesn't walk.

SPENCER BENNETT
I said niggers -








Z .ate`
Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Django, he's a free man, and
he can ride what he pleases.

SPENCER BENNETT
Not on my.property, around my niggers
he can't.
Dr.SCHULTZ
My good sir, perhaps we got off on the
wrong boot. Allow me to unring this bell.
My name is Dr.King Schultz, this is my
valet, Django, and these are our horses,
Fritz, and Tony.
Fritz, does his head bow.
This makes the pretty PONY'S surrounding Bennett, giggle.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, I've been lead to believe you
are a gentleman, and a business man.
And it is in these capacities that we've
ridden from Texas to Tennessee to talk
with you now.

SPENCER BENNETT
State your business.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I wish to purchase one of your
nigger gals.

SPENCER BENNETT
You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to
Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals,
no appointment, no nuttin'?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm afraid so.

SPENCER BENNETT
Well what if I say, I don't like you, or
your fancy pants. nigger, and I wouldn't
sell you a tinkers damn - what'cha gotta
say about that?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, if you are the business man,
I've been led to believe you to be,
I have five thousand things I might say,
that could change your mind.
i This gets everybody's attention, not least of all Spencer Bennett.
Spencer laughs.









ZG

SPENCER BENNETT
C'mon inside, get yourself something' cool
to drink.
The incognito bounty hunter, dismounts his steed, as does Django.
Then the good doctor walks up the steps to Bennett Manor.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Maybe while we discuss business, you
could provide one of your loveliest black
creatures to escort Django here around
your magnificent grounds.

SPENCER
Absolutely. Betina!
A pretty, fleshy, sweet jelled, twenty-two year old slave gal named
BETINA, snaps to attention.

BETINA
Yes sir, Big Daddy?

SPENCER

(TO SCHULTZ)
What's your Jimmies name again?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django.

SPENCER
Betina sugar, take Django around the
grounds. Show 'em all the pretty stuff.

BETINA
As you please, Big Daddy.
Dr.Schultz lowers his voice, and says to the plantation owner;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, I must remind, you, Django is a
free man. He cannot be treated like a slave.
Within the bounds of good taste, he must be
treated as an extension of myself.

SPENCER
Understood., Schultz. Betina?

BETINA
Yes, sir?

SPENCER
Django isn't a slave. Django is a free
man. Do you understand? You're not to treat
him like any of these other niggers around
here, cause he ain't like any of these
other niggers around here. Ya got it?









BETINA
Ya want I should treat 'em like white
folks?

SPENCER
No that's not what I said.

BETINA
Then I don't know what'cha want Big Daddy.

SPENCER
Yes, I can see that.

(HE THINKS)
What's the name of that peckawood boy from
town works with the glass? His mama works
at the lumber yard? He comes by and fixes
the winda's when we have a problem?
The MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR chimes in;

MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR
Oh, you mean Jerry.

SPENCER
Yeah, that's the boy's name, Jerry.

(TO BETINA)
You know Jerry, dont'cha sugar?

BETINA
Yes 'em, Big Daddy.

SPENCER
Well that's it then... just treat 'em
like you would Jerry.

EXT - ANOTHER PART OF BENNETT MANOR - DAY
Away from the big house, Betina gives Django a tour of the grounds.
Her in her slave get up, complete with handkerchief on her head, and
him in his satin baby blue Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, are quite
the pair. She eyeballs him disapprovingly up and down.

BETINA
What'cha do for your massa'?

DJANGO
Didn't you hear him tell ya, I ain't no slave.

BETINA
So you really free?

DJANGO
Yes.









ZY

BETINA
You mean you wanna dress like that?
Django fumes.

EXT - BENNETT MANOR (BACK PORCH) - DAY
Both Spencer Bennett and Dr.Schultz sit on the back porch drinking
lemonade.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I've been'told by those who should know,
the most exquisite African flesh in the
state of Tennessee is bred right here on
your land. And from the look of these
black angels, my sources weren't wrong.

SPENCER
Oh I got my share of, coal blacks, horse
faces, and gummy mouth bitches out in the
field. But the lion share of my lady
niggers are real show pony's.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well that's what I'm looking for, a show
pony for young Django. So the only
question that remains is, do you have a
nigger here worth five thousand dollars?

SPENCER
Dr.Schultz, five thousand dollar nigger,
is practically my middle name.

BACK TO DJANGO AND BETINA
Betina and Django walk by a big tree on the plantation grounds.
The cotton fields and the SLAVES picking it, in the background.

DJANGO
Betina, come over here, I need to ask
you something.
He moves her by the tree for more privacy. Betina thinks this fancy
pants wants to get all lovey-dovey, and she couldn't be less interested.

BETINA
What'cho want?

DJANGO
I'm lookin' for three white men. Three
brothers. Overseers. Their name is
Brittle. Do you know 'em?

BETINA
Brittle?









DJANGO
Yes, Brittle. John Brittle. Ellis Brittle.
And Roger Brittle, sometimes called, Little Raj.

BETINA
I don't know dem.

DJANGO
They could be usin' a different name.
They woulda' come to the plantation in
the last year.

BETINA
You mean The Shaffer's?

DJANGO
Maybe? Three brother?

BETINA
Ah-huh.

DJANGO
Are they here?

BETINA
Ah-huh.

DJANGO
Can you point one of 'em out to me?

BETINA
Well ones over in that field.
She points to the cotton field, at a OVERSEER on top of a horse, whip
in hand, eyeing the blacks at his mercy.
Django takes hold of a little bag slung over his shoulder opens it, and
takes out a shiny brass SPYGLASS, the type a sea captain might use.
Obviously a prop from Dr.Schultz. He slides it open, places it against
his eye, and points it in the direction of a figure out in the cotton
field landscape.

SPYGLASS POV:
Astride his nag, the filthy hillbilly, who calls himself SHAFFER, but
who Django knows to be ELLIS BRITTLE, looks on, oblivious to Django's
observation.

DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
He remembers Ellis Brittle BURNING a "r" into Broomhilda's cheek with a

BRANDING IRON.

BACK TO DJANGO AND THE SPYGLASS
he lowers the glass.









3 0

BETINA

(INNOCENTLY)
Is that who you lookin' for?

DJANGO
Yep.
He folds the spyglass back up, and puts it back in his purse.

DJANGO
Where's the other two?

BETINA.
They by the stable, punishin' Little Jody
for breakin' eggs.

DJANGO
They whippin' Little Jody?
She nods her head, yes.

DJANGO
Point me in that direction.
She points to a shed, and keeps pointing right.

BETINA
You go to that shed, and keep goin' that way.
Which means; "Go to the shed and turn right."

DJANGO
Go git that white man, I came here with.
He slaps her ass, to hurry her up.
Then looks to the shed, and begins crossing the distance between him
and The Brittle Brothers.

FLASH ON
A memory from The Carrucan Plantation; The Brittle Brothers giving his
wife Broomhilda, a peelin'.
PEELIN' : A punishment by bullwhip, across the back.
LITTLE RAJ makes a line in the dirt with the heel of his boot.
Making Django stand behind it, as he watches his wife being whipped.
BIG JOHN BRITTLE SLASHES the beauty of Broomhilda's back with his

BULLWHIP.
DJANGO, keeping behind the line, begs Big John for mercy.









3/

DJANGO
Please Big John, she won't do it no more!
She's real sorry!
The WHIP RIPS her back.

DJANGO

(SCREAMING)
Goddamit, Big John!

LITTLE RAJ
Whoa nigger, calm down, keep it funny.
Django gets on his knees, and on behalf of Broomhild.a, begs Big John
Brittle with everything he has.

BACK TO DJANGO
crossing the lawn towards The Brittle Brothers, like an express train.

FLASH ON
Big John Brittle standing over him, bullwhip in hand, saying to the

KNEELING DJANGO;

BIG JOHN BRITTLE
I like the way you beg, boy.

EXT - STABLE - DAY
Little Raj Brittle, ties LITTLE JODY, a petite slave girl (eighteen)
to a dead tree stump.
BIG JOHN BRITTLE paces, taking a few practice CRACKS with his WHIP.
LITTLE JODY begs The Shaffer Brothers/The Brittle Brothers for mercy.
ROGER goes and sits on a old wagon wheel to watch the whippin'.

BIG JOHN BRITTLE
Now Jody quit your caterwaulin'. You know
yourself it's for your own good. Niggers
are clumsy. You'd break everything in
goddamn sight, you weren't cured. And the
only known cure for nigger clumsiness
is a peelin'.
Little Jody begs to differ.

BACK TO DJANGO
As Django in his powder blue satin suit hurries across the grass to
Little Jody and The Brittle Brothers, he collects eight little friends
who happily run along with the fast walking man. EIGHT LITTLE FRENCH
BULLDOGS who bark, yelp, snort and breath at his heels.. Django pays the
little dogs no nevermind.









3 2-

BACK TO BIG JOHN BRITTLE
In position to take the skin off of Little Jody's back.

BIG JOHN
After this we'll see if you break eggs again.

DJANGO
turns the corner to the stable, and stands behind them. They don't see
him. Big John rears back to make the first WHIP LASH...

WHEN ...
.DJANGO'S VOICE, stops him;

DJANGO
John Brittle!
Big John breaks his whip stride, looks. up, and in a discarded full
length broken mirror from the big house, laying abandoned against the
stable wall, he see's DJANGO, dressed in his powder blue satin Little
Lord Flauntleroy outfit, surrounded by his pack of little French
Bulldogs.
LITTLE JODY on her knees, tied to the dead tree stump, looks up see's
the same thing in the mirror.
LITTLE RAJ looks to his left at the sounds of the voice.
BIG JOHN turns toward Django, who he still doesn't recognize.
DJANGO just stares back.
BIG JOHN smile disappears. He recognizes Django.
So does Roger.

LITTLE RAJ
Django?
Django crosses toward Big John, raising up his arm like he's going to
shake his hand ...

DJANGO
Remember me?
.Django extends his arm, and Dr.Schultz's Derringer arm
contraption,. POPS the TINY GUN into his hand, and he FIRES a tiny
bullet smack dab into BIG JOHN'S MERCILESS HEART.

BIG JOHN FACE
goes into shock... .he falls to his knees...he looks up, clutching his
heart, at Django.

DJANGO
I like the way you die, boy.









3 3
Big John hears it...then tips over dead.
LITTLE JODY can't believe what she's just seen.
FOUR OTHER SLAVES who just happen to be walking in the background, see
it.
LITTLE RAJ is stunned ... . then comes to his senses, fumbling for the
gun he wears on his hip, but since he's no gunman, in his haste, he
gets it out of his holster, but drops it on the ground.
It goes off... BANG.
SHOOTING himself in the foot, he HOPS UP AND DOWN in pain.
The Bulldogs scatter at the sound. of the BANG.
DJANGO picks Big John's WHIP off the ground., and begins WHIPPING
LITTLE RAJ across the face and chest.
MORE SLAVES gather.

DJANGO WHIPS HIM TO THE GROUND
whips him on the ground, then throws the whip to the ground, picks
Roger's pistol off the ground, and empties it (FIVE SHOTS) into Roger.
To say the slaves are flabbergasted, is a understatement.
Dr.Schultz rides his horse up quickly, rifle in his hand. He sees
Django, and the two dead bodies.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Who are they?

DJANGO
That's John Brittle, and that's his
little brother Raj.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Where's Ellis?

DJANGO
He's the one hightailin' it across that
field right now.
Ellis Brittle riding his horse full out through the cotton field trying
to make an escape.

SCHULTZ'S WINCHESTER
goes to his eye, he follows the rider with his rifle barrel.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Are you sure that's him?
Ellis gets further away...









DJANGO
Yes!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Are you positive?
Ellis gets further away...

DJANGO
I dunno.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You don't know if you're positive?
Ellis gets further away...

DJANGO
I don't know what, positive,'means.
Dr.SCHULTZ
It means you're sure.

DJANGO
Yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, what?

DJANGO
Yes I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

BAM!
The German picks the middle Brittle brother off his horse.
The dead man WIPES OUT horribly in the thick cotton brush.
RED BLOOD splashes on WHITE COTTON.
The German and Django have the entire plantation's attention.
Spencer Bennett (with his Winchester), his SONS and his OVERSEERS,
and some HOUSE NIGGERS come around like a angry mob.
The German tosses his rifle in the dirt, and raises his hands.
Django does the same with his pistol.
Dr.Schultz addresses the ANGRY MOB.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Everybody calm down, we mean no one else any harm!

SPENCER
Just who the hell are you two jokers?









35;
Drï¿½. SCHULTZ
I am Dr.King Schultz, a legal representative
of the criminal justice system of the
United States of America. The man to my
left is Django Freeman, he's my. deputy.
In my pocket is a warrant signed by circuit
court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin
Texas, for the arrest and capture, dead or
alive, of John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, and
Roger Brittle --

DJANGO
- They were goin by the name, Shaffer.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You know them by the name, Shaffer.
But the butchers real names'were Brittle.
These are wanted men. The law wants them
for murder. I reiterate, this warrant
states dead or alive. When Django and myself
executed these men on sight, we were operating
within our legal. boundaries. Now I realize
passions are high. But I must warn you,
the penalty for taking deadly force
against a officer of the court in the
performance of his duty is, you will be
hung by the neck until you are dead.
This does put a momentary pause in the lynch mob's blood lust.
After his dramatic pause for effect...
.Dr.Schultz says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
May I please remove the warrant from my
pocket so you may examine it?
Resting his Winchester over his shoulder, Bennett reaches for the
paper.

SPENCER
Gimmie.
Dr.Schultz removes the warrant from his jacket pocket, and hands it to
the plantation owner. Bennett reads it silently to himself, resigned to
what it says.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Satisfied.
Bennett eyes go from the warrant to the German.
Dr.SCHULTZ
May I have that back?









36
,- Bennett hands Schultz back the piece of paper.
Dr.SCHULTZ
We good?

BENNETT
Get off my land.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Post haste.

(TO DJANGO)
Load up the bodies as quickly as
you can, and let's get out of
here.

TIME CUT
All three dead Brittle Brothers lie over the back of the extra horse
the bounty hunters brought with them.
Both Bounty Hunters are back in their saddles ready to leave.
With all the eyes of the plantation on them, the white and black man
start to ride out, when Spencer "Big Daddy" Bennett, steps in their way
for one final threat.

BENNETT
Ain't nobody gonna touch you and your Jimmie
while you on my property. But for lettin' a
nigger kill a white man, and especially for
letting a nigger kill a white man in a
audience of niggers, y'all ain't gonna make
it out of the county alive. Mark my words
Schultz, by tomorrow morning your niggers
gonna be stripped and clipped and hangin'
from my motherfuckin' gate.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm fully aware Bennett, that you and your
regulator playmates aren't shy about
killing for what you believe in. But mark
my words Big Daddy, if you make a move
towards Django or myself, you better be
prepared to die for it.
The two men ride off.
The Black and White Audience watch them go.

Now unless they start shootin' first,
nobody shoot 'em. That's way too simple
for these jokers. We're gonna whip that
nigger lover to death. And I'm gonna
personally, strip and clip that garboon
myself.
Having said his blood thirsty words, he puts the flour sack over his
head. He tussles with the sack for a bit, then from inside the sack;

SPENCER BENNETT
Damn, I can't see fuckin' shit outta
this thing.
He sticks his fingers in the.eye holes, and rips, trying to make the
holes bigger, he only succeeds in making-visibility more obscured.

BRADSHAW
We ready, or what?









3 7

SPENCER BENNETT
Hold on I'm fuckin' with my eye holes.

(RIPS)
Shit ...I just made it worse.
He rips. it off his head in frustration.

RANDY
I can't see shit either.

REDFISH
Who made this goddamn shit?

0. B.
Willards wife.

WILLARD
Well make you own goddamn masks!

SPENCER

(TO WILLARD)
Look nobody's saying they don't appreciate
what Jenny did.

REDFISH
Well if all I hadda do was cut a bag, I
could cut it better then this.

0. B.
How 'bout-you Robert, can you see?

ROBERT
Not too good. I mean if I.don't move my head,
I can see you pretty good ... . more or less.
But when I start ridin' the bag starts moving
all over, and I'm riding blind.
Randy tears at his bag.

RANDY
Oh shit, I just made mine worse.
He puts it on-then says;

RANDY
Yep, it's worse.
He yanks it off his head.

RANDY
Did anybody bring any extra bags?

TERRY
No, no one brought a extra bag!









3 9

RANDY
I'm just asking.

DOUG
Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?

SPENCER
Shitfire, if you don't wear 'em as you ride
up, that just defeats the purpose.
Redfish, fatter then some (but not all), takes off his bag.

REDFISH
I can't see in this fucking thing!
I can't breathe in this fucking thing!
And I can't ride in this fucking thing!

WILLARD
Fuck all y'all! I'm going home. I watched
my wife work all day gettin' thirty bags
ready for you ungrateful sonsabitches!
And all I hear is criticize, criticize, criticize.
From now on don't ask me or mine for nothin'!
Willard rides off.
O.B. removes his bag, and yells after Willard.

SPENCER
O.B., I tole yo to keep quiet! They're asleep,
not dead.

O.B.
But Willards riding off.

SPENCER
Fuck Willard! Look, let's not forget why we're
here. We gotta killer nigger over that hill.
And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.

RANDY
Okay, I'm confused, are the bags on or off?
Robert takes off his bag, and says;

ROBERT
I think we all think the bags was a nice
idea. But, not pointing any fingers, they
could of been done better. So how 'bout,
no bags this time, but next time, we do the
bags right, and then we go full regalia.
Everyone takes off their bag.

SPENCER
Wait a minute, I didn't say no bags!









YO

TERRY
But nobody can see.

SPENCER
So?

TERRY
So, it would be nice to see.

SPENCER
Goddamit, this is a raid! I can't see, you
can't see, so what? All that matters is can
the fuckin horse see! That's a raid.
Spencer puts on his sack, everyone else, reluctantly, does as well.

EXT - LAKE - NIGHT
The THIRTY RIDERS, all with SACKS OVER THEIR HEADS, come riding over
the hill, hooting and hollerin. Since nobody can see they ride
haphazard into each other.'Redfish falls off his horse hard on his fat
ass. They surround the camp, and when the sleeping Schultz and Django
don't react, they know something's up. But since nobody can see,
everybody and everybody's horse is. confused.

WE HEAR A GROUP OF LINES FROM CIRCLING COWBOYS ON HORSEBACK WITH BAGS
OVER THEIR HEADS: "Where are they, I can't see" - "They tricked us" -
"Did somebody fall" "Where the hell are they" "Y'all, Redfish fell
off his horse-He's kinda hurt bad."
Then amongst the confusion...

WE SNAP ZOOM TO

A BIG TREE
on the other side of the lake
Then quickly cut into The Tree.
Till we're in a CU OF Dr.SCHULTZ
with a SCOPE SIGHT RIFLE up to his eye.

SCOPE SIGHT POV
The Yellow covered STICKS OF DYNAMITE protruding from the ground, are
inside the scope sight circle, Horse hooves step around it.

TWO SHOT
Dr.SCHtJLTZ and DJANGO up in a tree.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Auf wiedersehen.









L,
He fires.
The Camp EXPLODES Blowing Horses and Riders Apart.
Dr.Schultz and Django lift up repeating rifles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Let 'em have it!

DJANGO
I can't see nothin'.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Just fire into the smoke.
The two treetop killers let loose with rifle fire.

INSIDE OF THE SMOKE
pandemonium reigns. Horses and Men trip over bodies and pieces of
bodies, of horses and men. Men with legs and arms blown off, yell
bloody murder, hurt and scared Horses cry. Some struggle to get the
sacks off their heads, while scared horses dance and buck in panic.
Some are shot by the rifle fire. The rest of the men not blown up, and
still on horseback, between the sacks and the smoke, still can't see
worth a damn. And Men and Horses collide with one another, which causes
more bucking and riders falling. About fifteen of the men who can still
ride, high tail it the fuck out of there. Whipped and whimpering like
dogs.

SPENCER BENNETT
on his horse with the other fleeing regulators RIDES for his life...

SCOPE SIGHT POV
We see the back of the fleeing Bennett smack dab in the cross hairs.

DJANGO
scope sight rifle up to his eye.
Schultz next to him, says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
He's getting away.

DJANGO
I got 'em.

SPENCER'S HORSE
his hooves race and rip up the grass.

SPENCER
riding for his life...

DJANGO
scope sight rifle up to his eye.








Dr.SCHULTZ
He's getting out of range.

DJANGO
I got 'em.
INSERT: A black finger squeezes the rifle trigger.

SPENCER BENNETT
we're behind him as he rides away, OFF SCREEN we hear the whistling of
what sounds like an incoming missle.

SPENCER BENNETT
we're in.front of Spencer Bennett as he rides, when Django's bullet,
RIPS THROUGH his CHEST.

DJANGO

DJANGO
I got 'em.

SPENCER BENNETT
falls from his horse, dead.

DJANGO
scope sight rifle in his hand, big smile on his face, looks.to
Dr.Schultz.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Like that, huh?
Referring to the scope sight rifle;

DJANGO
I like.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, I think while they take this opportunity
to lick their wounds, we should take this
opportunity to get the fuck out of Tennessee.
They hop out of the tree.

MONTAGE
Dr.Schultz in a big city, buying Django a new saddle. Django gets his
first initial "D" etched into it. The men go to different stores to
purchase Django's wardrobe. The outfit bought, is selected by Django,
with suggestions offered by Schultz. When he's done, Django looks damn
handsome in his new duds. Brown cowboy boots, Green Corduroy Jacket,
Smokey Grey Shirt, Tan Skin Tight Pants, and Light Brown Cowboy Hat.
He looks a. bit like Elvis in "Flaming Star" and a Little Joe Cartwright
on "Bonanza". However, tellingly, he keeps Ace Speck's Winter Coat as
his winter coat.









EXT - COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
Django, sitting on his new saddle, in his new duds, rides alongside
the good doctor Schultz. The German carries a PICNIC BASKET.
Dr.SCHULTZ
But I'm serious son, Greenville is just too
dangerous for you to go fucking around there.
You're a freed, slave, you should be in New York.
You shouldn't be in Greenville, you shouldn't
even be forty miles on any side of Greenville.,
You shouldn't be anywhere in Mississippi.

DJANGO
She's my wife, it's my job to look after her.
If Greenville's where I gotta go to find out
where she went, then I gotta go. Now you
were sayin' where I gotta go first?
Dr.SCHULTZ
There'should be some sort of records office.
You know when she was sold, you know where
she came from, the Carrucan Plantation, and
you know her name ... . what is her name?

DJANGO
Broomhilda.
Schultz reacts.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Broomhilda?
Django.nods his head yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Were her owners German?
Now Django reacts, "How did he know that?

DJANGO
Yeah, how did you know? She wasn't born on
The Carrucan Plantation. She was raised by
a German mistress, The Von Shafts. She can
speak a little German too.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Your wife?

DJANGO
Yeah, when she was little her mistress taught
her so she'd have somebody to talk German with.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So let me get this straight, your slave
wife speaks German, and her name is
Broomhilda Von Shaft...?









DJANGO
Yep. Mouthful, huh?
Dr.SCHULTZ
To say the least.
(stopping the horse)
This looks like a very pretty place to have
our picnic. What'd ya say, here?

TIME CUT

EXT - PICNIC IN COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
The two men sit on a blanket with a nice picnic spread spread out.
Django eats a cucumber sandwich with the crust cut off, and drinks a
cup of tea.

DJANGO
How did you know Broomhilda's first masters
were German?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Broomhilda is a German name. If they named
her, it stands to reason they'd be German.

DJANGO
Lotsa gals where you from named Broomhilda?
Dr.SCHULTZ
No, not so much. Broomhilda is the name of
a character in one of the most popular of
all the German legends.

DJANGO
Really? There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes there is.

DJANGO
Do you know it?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Every German knows that story. Would you
like me to tell you?
Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well Broomhilda was a princess. She was the
daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods.
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

DJANGO
What she do.?








Dr.SCHULTZ
I don't exactly remember. I think she disobeys
him in some way. So at first he's just going to
obliterate her -

DJANGO
Obliterate... . what does that mean?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Like blow up.
He pantomimes a explosion.

DJANGO
Phew, that's pretty mad.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes it is, and like most fathers, given a
little time, he calms down a bit. He's
still mad at her. He still wants to punish her.
Just not ... . blow her up. So instead what he
does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain.

DJANGO
Broomhilda's on a mountain?
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's a German legend, there's always going
to be a mountain in there somewhere. So, he
puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a
fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
And. then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire.
And there Broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero
arises brave enough to save her.

DJANGO
Does a fella arise?
From now on as Dr.Schultz talks, he's beginning to realize something he
wasn't aware of when the conversation started.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes Django, as a matter he does. A fella
named, Sigfried.

DJANGO
Does Sigfried save her?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes he does, and quite spectacularly, so.
Now true, he is assisted in his triumph by
a truly, truly, remarkable sword, still, having
said that, Sigfried triumphs over all of his
obstacles not just due to his sword, but due to
his courage. He scales the mountain, because he's
not afraid of it. He defeats the dragon, because
he's not afraid.of him.








Dr.SCHULTZ (CON'T)
He walks through hellfire because
Broomhilda's worth. it.
After that last line of dialogue... .the two men just let a moment pass
as they nibble on their sandwiches.

DJANGO
I know how he feels.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I think I'm just starting to realize that.
He pours Django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot, as he
thinks about what he's going to say next.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Look Django, I don't doubt one day you will
save your lady love. But I'm afraid I can't
let you go to Greenville in a good conscious.
Let me ask you a question, how do you like
the bounty hunting business?

DJANGO
Kill white folks, and they pay ya?
What's not to like?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I hafta admit, we make a good team.

DJANGO
But I'thought you were mad at me for killin'
Big John and Rodger?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, on that occasion, you were a tad
overzealous. But normally, that's a good
thing. How'd you like to partner up for
the winter?

DJANGO
What'd ya mean partner up?
Dr.SCHULTZ
You be my deputy, for real this time. A lot
of the big money is in outlaw gangs. Some
of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or
three thousand a piece. With one man, anything
over three men is a risk. But with a partner?
Creating cross fire? It's fish in a. barrel.
A lot of these gangs hold up in the'hills
for the winter.

DJANGO
You makin' another agreement?









W7
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes. You work with me through the winter,
till the snow melts. I give you a third
of my bounties. And while we're together,
I'll teach you a few things you're going
to need to know.

DJANGO
Can you teach me how to make Tony do that
head bow thing that Fritz can do?
Dr.SCHULTZ
That among other things. We make some
money this winter, when the snow melts,
I'll take you to Greenville myself, and
we'll find where they sent your wife.
I'm pretty good at finding people. Is it a deal?
No white man has ever done anything for Django, just to him. So
understandably, he's a little suspicious.

DJANGO
Why you care what happens to me? Why you
care if I find my wife?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well frankly, I've never given anybody
their freedom before. And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you. You're
just not ready to go off on your own, it's
that simple. You're too green, you'll get hurt.
Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried,.
it's kind of a big deal. As a German, I'm
obliged to help you on your quest to
rescue your beloved Broomhilda.
Django accepts that response.
What follows is a MONTAGE covering the five months that Django and
Schultz partner up as bounty hunters. Schultz wears his normal
ensemble. Django wears his cool looking Green Jacket, unless it's
really cold, which a lot of this Montage is. Then he still wears Ace
Specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes.

WE SEE
A SCENE to be improvised (more or less), where Dr.Schultz teaches
Django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his hip.
By the end of the scene, after trial and error, we see Django's going
to be good at this.

EXT - HILLSIDE - SUNNY DAY
We see Django and Dr.Schultz walking up a hill. Tony and Fritz have
been left tied up downhill. Django leads a extra body HORSE (named
PONCHO) behind him. Dr.Schultz carries his scope sight rifle in 'a long
case. They get to the top of the hill. It overlooks a small farmhouse.









Y, 8

DOWN BELOW WE SEE
A LITTLE MAN struggling behind a plow, and his FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SON
helping him by leading the horse forward.
On top of their perch on the hill top, Dr.Schultz says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Keep down or he'll see you.

DJANGO
Who that farmer? Who cares?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well since we came here to kill 'em, he
just might.

DJANGO
What? The little man pushin' that plow?
Dr.SCHULTZ
That little man pushing that plow, is Smitty Bacall.

DJANGO
Smitty Bacall is a farmer?
Dr.SCHULTZ
No. Smitty Bacall is a stagecoach robber
who's hiding out as a farmer, because
there's a seven thousand dollar bounty on
his head.
He hands Django the scope rifle case.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And he's all yours my boy.
DJANGO lays on his belly, with the Scope Sight up to his eye.

SCOPE SIGHT POV:
on the Farmer struggling behind his plow, working hard with his horse
and his son.
Django's finger on the trigger... .but he hesitates.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh what happened.to mister I wanna kill white
folks for money?

DJANGO
His son's with him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good. He'll have a loved one with him.
Maybe even share a last word. That's
better then most get, and a damn. sight
better then he deserves.









1Ï¿½9
Django still hesitates.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Put down the rifle. Don't worry, I'm not
mad at you. Take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
Django removes the folded up handbill from the pocket of his tan pants.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Read it aloud. Consider it today's lesson.

DJANGO

(READING)
"Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
The Smitty Bacall Gang. For murder and
stagecoach robbery. Seven thousand dollars
for Smitty Bacall. One thousand and five
hundred dollars for each of his gang members.
Known members of The Smitty Bacall Gang are as
follows, DANDY MICHAELS, GERALD NASH, and

CRAZY CRAIG KOONS."
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well done. Bravo. THAT is who Smitty Bacall
is. If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at
twenty-two, they would never of printed that.

(REFERRING TO

THE HANDBILL)
But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches,
and he didn't mind killing people to do it.
You want to save your wife by doing what
I do? This is what I do. I kill people,
and sell their corpses for cash. His corpse
is worth seven thousand dollars.
Now quit your pussyfootin and shoot him.
Django SHOOTS.
The Little Man down below behind the plow falls down.
The Young Boy doesn't know what happened at first. Then he figures'out
his father was just shot. He goes to him in the dirt.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You need to keep that Smitty Bacall handbill.

DJANGO
Why?
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's good luck. You always keep the
handbill of your first bounty.
They begin walking down the hill, to collect Smitty Bacall's body,
leading the extra body horse behind them.









50
As they walk down hill, they watch the little scene of Smitty Bacall's
Son cradling his dying father.in his arms, the older man speaking his
last words to his son before he dies.
Dr.SCHULTZ
See, they're having a tender little father son
moment now. No doubt the most heartfelt one
they've ever had.

EXT - SNOWY FOREST - NIGHT
It's now full on snowy winter in the hills.
Django practices his quick draw against a SNOWMAN he's built. He sticks
a BOTTLE in it, so the bottom of the bottle is where the snowman's
heart would be.
He DRAWS...
Shoots the bottle heart!
He DRAWS ...
Shoots the left coal eye.
He DRAWS ...
Shoots the right coal eye.
He DRAWS...
Shoots the carrot nose.
Dr.Schultz comes up behind him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I think it's safe to say you're faster then
the snowman.

EXT - SNOWY FOREST - DIFFERENT NIGHT
A outlaw gang known as The WILSON - LOWE GANG (five guys) ride through
a snowy forest at night. When all five men and their Horses, are SHOT

FROM ABOVE.

DJANGO AND SCHULTZ
up in a tree, FIRING DOWN ON them.

EXT - WINTER MOUNTAIN TOWN MAIN STREET - NIGHT
The FLAKES continue to FALL HARD as Dr.Schultz and Django ride down
the main street of town, pulling poor Poncho who's FULLY LOADED DOWN
with five corpses.









571
The local SHERIFF, DON GUS, watches the two men ride up, he knows them.

SHERIFF GUS
Doctor and Django, how the hell are ya,
and who the hell ya got there?
Dr.SCHULTZ
The Wilson - Lowe Gang.

SHERIFF GUS
Who the hell's The Wilson - Lowe Gang?
Dr.Schultz removes a handbill from his inside jacket pocket, and hands
it down to the friendly peace officer.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Bad Chuck Wilson, and meaner Bobby Lowe.
And three of their acolytes.

SHERIFF GUS
Just leave 'em out here, they ain't going
nowhere. And if'in they do, god must love
'em, so who are we to say. Come outta the
snowy snow and git yourself some coffee.

TNT - SHERIFF GUS'S OFFICE - NIGHT
The snow encrusted bounty hunters come inside the lawmans office.
They exchange pleasantries about the weather as the Sheriff pours them
coffee. After the two frosty gentlemen have drunk some of the hot
liquid, they get down to business. As Schultz and Gus discuss the
bounties, Django reads the handbills aloud from off the wall. On the
third one he reads, WARREN VANDERS, and a two thousand dollar bounty,
"That one", Schultz says.
Django RIPS IT off the wall.
As the winter has progressed, we see they've become a genuine bounty
hunting team. And Django, a genuine bounty hunter.

EXT - PRETTY MEADOW - DAY
The snow has melted, and it's SPRING. And inside of this meadow Django
practices his fast draw against five men...
.by Schultz throwing FIVE COINS in the air ...
DJANGO DRAWS FAST shoots three coins, FIRES again hitting another, then
falls to the ground to get the fifth.
He looks up from the ground at Schultz.









5L
As Schultz collects the coins off the ground, he says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You're pretty confident aren't you?
Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You have reason to be.
He holds out his fist, opens his hand, the coins lay in his palm.
All the coins have bullet holes dead in their center. He drops them on
top of Django.

DJANGO
Still think I'm too green for Greenville?
Dr.Schultz removes a pipe, sticks it in his mouth and says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh you're ready for Greenville.
He lights a match, then lights the pipe, puffing as he says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Greenville ready for you, that I'm not so
sure.
He blows out the match...

WE GO TO BLACK
What we also saw in the above montage is Django shake off a lifetime of
slavery. Django, in his green jacket, in his cowboy hat, on top of his
steed Tony, with his gun hanging from his hip, has become his own man.
He's not a slave anymore. He's a bounty hunter.

BLACK TITLE CARD
ACROSS THE SCREEN ONE LETTER AT A TIME STYLE (ala "Rocky" and

"FLASHDANCE")

MISSISSIPPI

CUT TO

EXT - THE TOWN OF GREENVILLE MISSISSIPPI - DAY
The whole Main Street of Greenville is thick with five inches of shit
brown mud that all the horse hooves, and wagon wheels, and slave feet
have to wade through to get from one end of the town to the other.









53
We see Django and Dr.Schultz enter the town, and slosh their horses in
the mud,, down the main street of Greenville Mississippi. The buying and
selling of slaves is what the whole town is built around.
BLACK MEN, WOMEN, and CHILDREN in BONDAGE are everywhere you look.
LINES OF CHAINED SLAVES being marched one way or the other, move
through the muddy streets of Greenville. WHITE MEN on horses move them
along.
BUCKBOARDS filled with DOMESTIC SLAVES (HOUSE NIGGERS), and pretty
PONYS, driven by WHITE MEN roll through the street.
A YOUNG WHITE BOY (14 years old), a shepherd, leads a bunch of
SLAVE CHILDREN through town. A SHEPHERD'S DOG, HELPS HIM OUT BY MOVING

THE KIDS ALONG.
Impromptu slave auctions take place on almost every block.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS on the bottom of the screen:

GREENVILLE

CHICKASAW COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI
Dr.Schultz takes in this African flesh market, where human beings sell
other human beings, with disgust and a little bit of shock.
Django is neither disgusted or. shocked, he knows first hand how
Greenville operates.
As he rides Tony through town in his snappy duds, he looks'at the BLACK
MEN half dressed: in chains. He REMEMBERS HIMSELF with his six Other
Companions from earlier, being walked through the mud of Main Street by
The Speck Brothers. On that day he might as well of been a steer.
Today, with a gun on his hip, money in his pocket, in his snappy
outfit, astride his steed Tony, he feels so different from these
wretched half naked bastards it gives him a bit of a chill.
Django sees the towns railroad depot, and across from it a huge SLAVE
PEN, like a STEER CORRAL. At the moment there's no train in the depot.

WE FLASH ON
The TRAIN, at a earlier time, pulling into the depot.

INSIDE ONE OF THE BOXCARS
amidst a boxcar full of shirtless BLACK MALES, Django watches the train
pull into the station, from inside the wooden slates of the boxcar.:
A hatch in the roof of the boxcar is NOISILY YANKED OPEN, and TWO WHITE
SLAVE TRADERS (RUSS AND JUDD), peer down at their human cargo.

JUDD
Good god almighty these niggers stink!









I F

RUSS
Niggers stink, where's the shock?
(to the Slaves

BELOW)
Okay you bucks, listen up, and listen
well, I'm only gonna say this once.
There's a slave corral right across from
this boxcar. We gittin ready to open these
doors. When we do, y'all run as fast as you
can, right into that pen. 'Anyone gittin off
trail, gonna get hurt and hurt bad. Now you
niggers better comprehend. And that goes for

better shove your ass in the right direction,
or your trip to this country is going to be
short, and pointless. Train to pen as fast as
you can!
The boxcar door is slid open, and a HUNDRED AND FIFTY BLACK MALES
run full out from the train to the steer corral.
We spot Django during the running.
Once inside the corral, the gate is closed.
COWBOYS with rifles act as prison guards.

INSIDE THE CORRAL
through the wooden posts, in the distance, Django watches them open up
the boxcar holding the females. They do their run to their pen out of
view.
Django catches a quick glimpse of Broomhild.a running with the other
LADIES, then she's gone from view.

BACK TO DJANGO (PRESENT)
Django and Dr.Schultz on top of their horses, taking in the sight of
Greenville.
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's a spectacle out of Dante.

DJANGO
You should see it from the other side.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Frankly, I don't know if I could endure this.

DJANGO
You'd be surprised what you can endure.

CUT TO

INT - RECORDS OFFICE - DAY
Dr.Schultz and Django walk into a records office, lined with books.
We watch through the store front window, the black man and white man
enter, and Dr.Schultz present his business card to a Dickensian looking
RECORDS OFFICE WORKER. As Schultz starts his spellbinding with words
routine... . The CAMERA FADES TO BLACK.

BROOMHILDA

INT - SLAVE PEN - DAY
The same shot we saw before of Django fighting his way to the bars of
the slave pen, to get a better last look of Broomhilda.
Broomhilda, as before is walked by in the distance.
Then, as before Django loses sight of her.

EXT - MAIN STREET - GREENVILLE - DAY
We follow in front of Broomhilda being lead out of the slave pen by TWO
WHITE MALE SLAVERS. Her bare feet slosh in the Main Street mud, and
the leg irons scrap her ankles.
Up until now everything you've ever seen of Broomhilda, has only been
in Django's Spaghetti Western Flashbacks. In other words, from his
perspective, and memory. This is the,only time the story will shift to
Broomhilda's perspective. The strong but frightened girl is led out on
to the hustle and bustle, and wagon wheels and horse hoofs of Main
Street.
Broomhilda is not taken into that three story auction arena that Django
was sold in at the beginning. Instead She's just lifted up on a parked
buckboard wagon. Her SELLER (CLYDE) starts his pitch on the TWELVE or
so BUYERS that watch this puny make shift auction.

BROOMHILDA
looks down into the crowd of twelve ugly white men, and holds her
breath which one will buy her.
Among the ugly white men we see Mr.HARMONY (MIKE), not quite as ugly as
the rest. An older well dressed, classy gentleman. Next to him is his
twenty four year old overweight awkward son SCOTTY HARMONY.








Scotty in the audience, and Broomhilda on the wagon, THEIR EYES MEET,
he nudges his dad.
The Seller makes her expose her breasts to the small crowd. Then her
back, revealing her whip marks. Then pointing out the runaway "r"
branded in her cheek.
Some of the crowd, including Scotty, react with repulsion at the sight
of the whip marks. The Seller assures the crowd, that niggers don't
feel pain like white folks, and it only makes the women more gentle.

SELLER - CLYDE
Fellahs, you ain't felt gentle, till you felt
nigger gal gentle.

UGLY MAN

BROOMHILDA

They look at each other as Mr.Harmony continues to bid.
A LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.









NARRATOR (VO)
On that day, eight months ago, the auction
was won by Mike Harmony, as a birthday present
for his fat boy son Scotty.
Mr.Harmony congratulates his son.
From on top of the buckboard Broomhilda looks down at her new owners.
Later they leave for the Harmony house. Scotty lifts Broomhilda up into
the back of the buckboard. He hands her a little white bag.

SCOTTY
This is for you.
She opens the bag,candies of many colors sit in it.

SCOTTY
They're jelly beans. Try one.
She selects a yellow one and puts it in her mouth.

SCOTTY
Good huh?
She nods her head, yes.
We see him drive the buckboard out of Greenville with Broomhilda in the
back eating her bag of jelly beans.

$XT - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
The buckboard makes its way down a country road. Broomhilda in the
back, and Scotty driving the wagon.
Scotty bought her, but he's too scared to talk to her.
Broomhilda's muddy bare feet dangle off the wagon. She's beginning to
realize the young master is the shy type.

BROOMHILDA
Master Scotty... ?

SCOTTY
Yes Broomhilda?

BROOMHILDA
I'm lonely back here. Can I come on up with
you on that seat so we can talk?

SCOTTY
Please, I'd love that.
She climbs into the driver's seat. In more ways then one.

EXT - THE HARMONY HOUSE - DAY
A nice two story southern house. Very nice, but hardly a plantation.
The household's FOUR DOMESTIC SLAVES. Broomhilda will be the fifth. The
buckboard pulls up to the front of the house.
Scotty's mother, Mrs.HARMONY (MARY LOUISE), waits to meet her son, and
his new bought nigger gal.
The older lady looks the black girl up and down and says to her;
Mrs.HARMONY
What's your name, gal?

BROOMHILDA
Broomhilda.
Mrs.HARMONY
Follow me. into the kitchen,
('to her son)
You stay out here.

INT - KITCHEN - DAY
Mrs.Harmony brings Broomhilda in her kitchen. The TWO DOMESTIC SLAVES
that were in, there are chased out by the boss lady. Mrs.Harmony grabs
Broomhilda by the wrist, and tells her;
Mrs.HARMONY
I want to have a word with you, wench. You met
my boy Scotty. You can tell ain't no white
girl gonna fool with him. And if they do fool
with him, they fool with him for the wrong
reason. Boy's twenty four, he still ain't a
man yet. That's why you're here. Be nice to him.
He's a very sweet boy. Play him right, he'll
eat bird seed out of your palm. Play 'em
wrong, you'll deal with me.

BROOMHILDA
I like Scotty. He's just shy is all. All he
needs is a little confidence.
Mrs.HARMONY
And you'll give that to him?

BROOMHILDA
I'll do my best, mam. Scotty's a real sweet boy.
Mrs.HARMONY
He is, isn't he?

BROOMHILDA
Ah-huh.
The mother lets go of the young lady's wrist.

NARRATOR (VO)
Basically The Harmony's bought a slave
bride for young master Scotty that day.
And the two kids had a nice time playing
house for awhile.
We see Scotty and Broomhilda catching butterflies in butterfly nets in
the daytime..
At night they catch LIGHTNING BUGS together.
At night in Scotty's bed, while the young man lay fast asleep,
Broomhilda looks at her jelly jar of GLOWING LIGHTNING BUGS.

NARRATOR (VO)
As Scotty's sort of defacto sweetheart, if
no visitors were about, Broomhilda would
even join the family at their dinner table.
We see them at dinner eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes and
gravy.

NARRATOR.(VO)
And pretty soon she was adopted into a
member of the family.

NARRATOR (VO)
After three months of this bliss,
Scotty decided to take Broomhilda for
a romantic weekend in Greenville.

SCOTTY AND BROOMHILDA
drive through the Main Street of Greenville, dressed to the nines, in a
fancy carriage. Broomhilda dressed in a beautiful white lace dress,
complete with white lace gloves, fancy ladies hat, and white parasol.
Scotty, very proud of his pretty Pony, is dressed in a fashion best
described as plantation pimp daddy.









6O

NARRATOR (VO)
White masters would take their pretty
Ponys to Greenville for a treat or romantic
excursion, for two reasons-One, seeing
how bad the other slaves had it, always made
the papered Ponys appreciate their privilege
position, (just in case they'd forgot).

BROOMHILDA
holding her parasol, looking like a black Daisy Miller, watches the
OTHER SLAVES march by in the mud. They watch her too.

INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
Broomhilda and Scotty, and their luggage, move into the fancy hotel
lobby, and rent a room at the front desk.

INSERT: HOTEL REGISTRY
Scotty signs his name. The DESK CLERKS HAND checks the box on the
registry book that indicates darkee female companion.

INT -. GREENVILLE - NIGHT
Greenville at night is a little different. At night, RICH WHITE MASTERS
showing off their Ponys (like Scotty), rule the streets.

NARRATOR (VO)
And two, there was a sliver of society that
ran through Greenville at night that catered
to white masters who were infected with a
condition that was normally referred to as,
"Nigger love." At night the streets, the bars,
bistros, and buggy rides were ruled by rich
white masters showing off their pretty Pony's.

EXT - CLEOPATRA CLUB - NIGHT
An establishing shot.of the three story house that has been converted into

INT - THE CLEOPATRA CLUB - RESTAURANT - NIGHT
The interracial joint is jumping (as long as by interracial you mean
white men and black women).
Scotty and Broomhilda are enjoying a fancy dinner in the clubs dining
room.
We see across the dining room, the powerful white man, CALVIN CANDIE,
sitting with some White Men and some Black Ponys, eyeing Broomhilda.

SCOTTY
I gotta tell you Broomhilda -
I don't care if I go to. hell for this -
I love you. And if loving you means I go to
hell ... . Well then hello Mr.Devil.
That was actually kind of funny. Broomhilda was right, all he needed
was a little confidence. She puts her hand on his.

NARRATOR (VO)
Then... speak of the devil and the devil
appears.

CALVIN CANDIE
appears at their table.

CALVIN CANDIE
Hello, my name is Calvin Candie, I own
The Cleopatra Club. And I would just like
to welcome an attractive couple'like
yourselves to my favorite place on earth.
Scotty stands up and shakes hands with Calvin.

SCOTTY
Thank you so much, it's a great honor.
We love it here.
Pointing at a empty chair.

CALVIN CANDIE
May I join you?-

SCOTTY
Please, by all means.
Calvin sits down.
Broomhilda gets a sinister chill from this smiling jack.
Scotty, as per usual, is clueless.

CALVIN CANDIE
How long have you been a member?









SCOTTY
We just joined this weekend.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well our little private oasis appreciates
your patronage. Some may consider the dues
excessive, but they're necessary for us to
create this haven for the alternative
lifestyle we've all become accustomed to.

SCOTTY
Well said, and money well spent.
He squeezes Broomhilda's hand.
Candie sees this.

CALVIN CANDIE
It would be.my pleasure, your first
weekend at the club, to join me and my
friends at my table.
Broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided.
But Scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like Calvin Candie.
She tries to imply they should stay where they are. He brushes her off
with a, "Don't be silly."
We see Calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple, and they
join the party.
Calvin Candie has his arm around a foxy Pony named SHEBA, whose dress
is a little more revealing then the others.
They drink and talk, and the White Men have a forced good time. But
Calvin Candie can't hide his sinister side from Broomhilda, and it
keeps her uncomfortable, until she excuses herself from the table to go
to bed. Scotty's having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts
to stay behind.'Broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff, due to Scotty's
disobedience. If these fancy.fucking white men weren't around making
Scotty feel so puffy chested, he'd never dismiss her that way.
We FOLLOW Broomhilda out of the club, across the street, to the hotel.

NARRATOR (VO)
After excusing herself, she walked across
the street to her hotel room. She got
her white dress dirty in the mud, but she
didn't care, the night was ruined anyway.
Some romantic weekend. Wait till she gets
home and tells his mother how he ignored her.
She'll fix his fat ass. Wait till he asks her
to scratch his back next time. She's gonna
scrape every pimple.

ï¿½-. BACK AT THE CLEO CLUB
The now drunk Scotty is playing poker with Calvin and his friends.

NARRATOR (VO)
Back at The Cleopatra Club, as the night
wore on, Calvin Candie suggested'a friendly
card game. As the game wore on, it came down
to a two thousand dollar pot between
Calvin Candie and Scotty Harmony. Luckily
for him, Scotty was holding.a inside straight.
Calvin holds his cards with Sheba draped around him. She whispers
something in his ear.

CANDIE

(TO SHEBA)
Really?

(TO SCOTTY)
You know what Sheba just tole me?
Scotty, thinking about his great hand, says;

SCOTTY
What?

CANDIE
She says she thinks you're cute.

SCOTTY
Really? Thank you Sheba, I think you're
beautiful.
Sheba whispers something else in Candie's ear.

CANDIE
Sheba says she'd like to give you a little
lip. Want some lip?
Scotty, is a little surprised.

SCOTTY
Well, she's your Pony...I mean...

CANDIE
Oh hush, what's a little nigger lip 'tween
friends. Go on honey, give 'em some sugar.
Sheba walks over to Scotty's side of the table, and gives him a very lip
intensive'soul kiss. The table enjoys the show. Then Sheba goes back to
Calvin's side of the table.
The game continues.









G

CANDIE
Okay loverboy, I think you're trying to out
brazen me in my own club, and I won't have
it. If you're really holding cards, time to
pony up. I raise you five hundred.
Candie throws in his chips.

SCOTTY.
I see your five hundred...
(throws in chips)
.and raise you four hundred more.
(tosses his last chips)
Call.
This is where Calvin Candie has waited to be all night.

CALVIN CANDIE
Not so fast, boy.

(BEAT)
Pot ain't fat enough yet.

SCOTTY
I'm all in.

CALVIN CANDIE
Ain't that too bad.
Scotty doesn't intend to let this smiling Jack cheat him out of his
pot, especially with him holding an inside straight.

SCOTTY
I would think a southern gentleman of
such renown as yourself, wouldn't have
to resort to buying a pot in his own club.
Calvin writes on a piece of paper, then throwsit'in the pot.

CALVIN CANDIE
One final raise.
Scotty takes the piece of paper, "What's this?"

CALVIN CANDIE
It's Sheba's bill of sale.

SCOTTY
What? I don't want her.
Calvin.and the whole table laugh at that.

CALVIN CANDIE
You sure didn't look like you didn't want her.
More laughter.









CALVIN CANDIE
In Greenville slaves are currency. And
Sheba's worth about eight hundred dollars.
I'm throwing Sheba in the pot. Match or
fold?

SCOTTY
I'm all out of money.

CALVIN CANDIE
But we ain't playin' for money no more..
We matchin' nigger gals. And a nigger gal
you got.

SCOTTY
I can't bet Broomhilda.

CALVIN CANDIE
In Chickasaw County, she's money. Pony her up
or fold. Somebody get him a piece of paper
and a pencil.
Somebody does.

CALVIN CANDIE
Write out a bill of sale, or fold them cards.
Scotty makes a pressured decision.
He hurriedly takes the pencil and writes out a Bill of Sale for
Broomhilda.

SCOTTY
Let me see your cards!
Candie lays down his cards, he has a FLUSH.
What Scotty's just done hits him like a ton of bricks.

SCOTTY
You cheated me.
After Scotty uses the "C" word, everybody quiets down.

CALVIN CANDIE
What did you just call me?

SCOTTY
I called you a card cheatin' son of a bitch,
cause that's what you are!
Calvin calmly stands up from the table. He removes a small Derringer
Gun.from his pocket, and tosses it on the table in front of Scotty.
Then takes out another one, and tosses it on the table in front
himself .









66
Everybody in The Cleo Club quiets down.

CALVIN CANDIE
Scott Harmony. For calling me a card cheat
in my own club, as a southern gentleman,
I challenge you to a duel.
(to the Piano

PLAYER)
Piano player, will you hit three separate
notes?

(TO SCOTTY)
On the third note, pick up the gun and
try to kill me.
(to Piano player)
Piano player please ...
This is all going too fast for slow Scotty.

SCOTTY
Wait a minute ...no!

FIRST NOTE ...

SCOTTY
I ain't dueling with you! I don't want
to duel!

CALVIN CANDIE
Then get out of here, get in your buggy
and get out of town.

SCOTTY
Sure. Let me just get my girl.

CALVIN CANDIE
You lost that girl, fat boy.

SECOND NOTE...

SCOTTY
Wait!... . Look ... . Mr.Candie, I'm sorry I
called you a cheat. But... please...I can't
give you Broomhilda.

CALVIN CANDIE
Last chance fat boy, go home and get'useta
to fuckin' another one.

(BEAT)
Or pick up that gun.
Scotty can't leave. He can't go home without her. He can't face his
parents. He can't walk out on her. No matters what happens he can't
leave.

INT - GREENVILLE SLAVE AUCTION - DAY
Back inside the three story Auction Block domed room.
The same room Django was sold in at the beginning.
Tons of WHITE BUYERS and SELLERS and BLACK SLAVES to be bought or sold
fill the big hall.

ONE MANDINGO SLAVE (BANJO)
stands half naked on the auction block.
The SELLER' (SHELBY)
gives the crowd,a sales pitch about Banjo, and starts the bidding.
Many different UGLY WHITE MEN make bids on the big mandingo, including
Calvin Candie.
Dr.SCHULTZ and DJANGO from a pair of OPERA GLASSES
/-. watch Calvin Candie from up above on the 2nd floor landing.
FROM Dr.SCHULTZ'S PERSPECTIVE
We see Calvin Candie, and his black slave.bodyguard, BARTHOLOMEW,
always dressed in a slightly ill fitting three piece suit and bowler
hat, among the crowd of buyers at the auction block below.
Candie's lawyer LEONIDE MOGUY joins him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Calvin Candle, and he is the
owner of Candyland.

DJANGO
Candyland? The mandingo fightin' place?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, so you heard of it?

DJANGO
Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well apparently, that's where your wife is,
and apparently the repellent gentleman down
there is the one who owns her.

The White Man and Black Man find a cubby hole to talk in the auction
hall.
Dr.SCHULTZ
How much do you know about mandingo fighting?

DJANGO
Not so much... A little... Master Carrucan had
a couple niggers he'd fight.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Can you play a mandingo expert?

DJANGO
What?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Can you convincingly masquerade as someone
who is an expert on mandingo fighters?

DJANGOÂ€¢
Why?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Because when a man has one of the four
biggest cotton plantations in Dixie, but
the only thing that seems to ring his chimes
is big sweaty black males, if WE want to get
his attention, we better be talking about
big sweaty black males. So my character is
that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here
in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo
fight game. And your character is the mandingo
expert I hired to help me do it.

DJANGO
They call that "One-Eyed Charly."
Dr.SCHULTZ.
One-Eyed Charly?

DJANGO
That's what you call it when you buy a slave
expert. If you wanna raise horses, but don't
know nothin' 'about horses, you buy yourself
a One-Eyed Charly who knows about horses.
He teaches ya. You wanna plant tobacco but
don't know nothin' about it, you buy yourself
a One-Eyed Charly knows about tobacco.
Dr'. SCHULTZ
Why do they call it One-Eyed Charly?









70

DJANGO
You know, back on the plantation, my. job
wasn't historian.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Testy. It's an unusual name. That's a perfectly
legitimate question. So, can you convincingly
play my mandingo One-Eyed Charly? Don't say,
yes, if you can't.

DJANGO
You want me to play a black slaver? There
ain't nothin lower then a black slaver. Black
slavers are lower then head house niggers, and
buddy, that's pretty fuckin low.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Then play him that way! Give me your black slaver.
Django gets that.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Can you do that?

DJANGO
That, I can do. What's next?
Dr.SCHULTZ
To get ourselves personally invited to
Candyland by Calvin Candie himself.

Some are one man with two or three or more women.
The white men's ages range from early twenties to old men.
The girls ages ranges from their twenties, to thirteen.
The bill of fare is a combination of French cuisine, and hearty beef
driven American dining.
The dolled up, decked out'Ponys eat rich French cuisine complete with
elaborate sauces, and take their knives to thick cuts of steak.
The younger little girls, usually eat ice cream with hot fudge, banana
splits, and cookies.
While-all the men drink whiskey or wine, the girls all drink
sarsaparilla.
Dr.Schultz quietly moves next to Django and asks;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Have you ever seen anything like this
before?
Django shakes his head, no.

COCO CHIRPS;

COLO. -

(VERY COUNTRY)
Y'all gonna dine, it's real good. You
like catfish, we got good catfish. They use
alotta butta. You like sand dabs, we
got sand dabs.
LEO MOGUY descends from the clubs prominent staircase.

MOGUY
Dr.Schultz, good to see you again.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Moguy, thank you for your assistance
in creating the opportunity for this
appointment.
Mr.MOGUY
Nonsense, it's my job.

(CON'T)









73
Mr.MOGUY

(CON'T)

(LOOKING AT

DJANGO)
.So this'is the One-Eyed Charly I've heard
so much about.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, this is Django.. Django, this is Mr.Candie's
lawyer, Leonide'Moguy.

MOGUY
Just call me Leo. Calvin's in the billiard
room, follow me. Y'all want Coco should come
along too?
Dr.SCHULTZ
We would be quite lucky indeed if the
charming Coco cared.to follow.
Coco blushes.

MOGUY
You better watch out doctor, you gonna
steal this little pony's heart.
They walk through the club to get to the billiard room, as they do they

SAY;
Dr.SCHULTZ
How long have you been associated with
Mr.Candie?

MOGUY
Calvin and I were about eleven when we
went to boarding school together. One
could almost say, I was raised to be
Calvin's lawyer.

DJANGO
One could almost say, you a nigger.
Coco can't believe what this snappy looking cowboy nigger just said to
Mr.Moguy.

MOGUY
What did you say?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh nothing, he's just being cheeky.
Anything else about Mr.Candie I should
know before I meet him?

MOGUY
Yes, he's a bit of a Francophile.









7EF
Dr.SCHULTZ
What civilized people aren't?

MOGUY
That's why all the French ambiance. And
he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mister Candie.
Dr.Schultz says in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
Dr.SCHULTZ

(FRENCH)
What ever he prefers.
This stops Moguy, and he turns to warn Schultz.

MOGUY
Oh he doesn't speak French. Don't speak
French to him, it'll embarrass him.
They get to the two sliding doors that lead to the billiard room.
Moguy slides the doors open...
The party enters the billiard room.

INT - BILLIARD ROOM (CLEOPATRA CLUB) - NIGHT
Inside is Calvin Candie, his bodyguard Bartholomew (still dressed in
the ill fitting suit), and the lanky sexy Sheba.
Also, at this moment, TWO MANDINGOS are having a bloody and savage
fight to death in this closed room.
An older European looking man, who's rooting for the mandingo that
Calvin's not rooting for, is also in the room. His name is.AMERIGO

VASSEPI.
Before any introductions can be made, with his back to the new arrivals
and his eyes on the black men fighting for their life, Calvin says;

CALVIN CANDIE
Why do you want to get in the mandingo
business?
That's quite abrupt and aggressive.
Dr.Schultz says, as if he's just been massively insulted;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You don't intend to allow your 2nd...
(referring to Moguy)
.to make the proper introductions?
Without turning towards them, Candie tells Schultz;









7S

CALVIN CANDIE
Quit stalling and answer the question.
The room is quiet.
Dr.SCHULTZ
The awful truth?

(PAUSE)
I'm bored, and it seems like a good
bit of fun.
Candie takes that to heart. He'll accept it for now.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well come on over, cause we gotta us a fight
goin on that's a good bit of fun_
Dr.Schultz steps up to get a better look at the savage fight.
The bigger mandingo is really hurting the smaller one.
Schultz has schooled Django on the importance of never BREAKING
CHARACTER.' Well now the good doctor must practice what he preaches.
Which means not only must he watch. the two men beat each other to
death, he must appear to convincingly enjoy it.

CALVIN CANDIE.
The bigger nigger is mine. I just bought
him today. What's his name, Moguy?

MOGUY
Big Fred.

CALVIN CANDIE
The other nigger belongs to this disreputable
Italian gentlemen to my right. Amerigo Vassepi.

(TO AMERIGO)
What's your nigger's name?

AMERIGO
Luigi... .?
Candie looks over at Django; who doesn't walk over to watch the fight.
Instead he walks over to a bar set up in the room. A slave bartender
named, ROSCOE tends it.

CALVIN CANDIE
How 'bout you, boy? You find nigger fightin'
a good bit of fun?

DJANGO
You seen one nigger fight, ya seen 'em all.

CALVIN CANDIE
How'd you two like to try the signature drink
of the club?









79
Dr.SCHULTZ
We'd love to.

CALVIN CANDIE
(yelling to the

BARTENDER)
Roscoe, two Polynesian Pearl Divers, and
don't spare the rum.
Roscoe makes the drinks in coconut shell glasses.
Big Fred kills Luigi.
Candie and his friends cheer.

CALVIN CANDIE
Arrivederci Luigi! Well, Mr.Vassepi, looks
like you owe me ten dollars.
Amerigo pays up the puny bet.
Django and Schultz get the fancy coconut shell drinks. They both take a
sip. Schultz hates it, Django loves it.
Candle turns his attention to Django.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's your name, boy?
Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Django.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
Where'd ya dig him up?
Dr.SCHULTZ
A fortuitous turn of events brought
Django and myself together.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO DJANGO)
I've heard tell about you. I heard you're a
real bright boy.

(BEAT)
I'm curious, what makes you such a
mandingo expert?

DJANGO
I'm curious, what makes you so curious?
Bartholomew puts down his pool cue, and turns toward Django;

BARTHOLOMEW
What you say, boy?









77
/ï¿½. Candie puts a calming hand on Bartholomew's shoulder.

CALVIN CANDIE
Calm down Bartholomew, gentle... gentle.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Monsieur Candie, I would appreciate it if
you directed your line of inquiry to me.

CALVIN CANDIE
Doc, I'm a seasoned slaver, you are a
neophyte. I'm simply trying to ascertain
if this cowboy is taking advantage of you.
Dr.SCHULTZ
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie, I
didn't seek you out for your advice. I
sought you out to purchase a fighting
nigger at above top dollar market price.
I was'under the impression when you
granted me an audience, it would be to
discuss business.

CALVIN CANDIE
No we weren't talking business yet. We
were discussing my curiosity.
Now according to Moguy here, if I do
business with you...

(POINTING TO

SCHULTZ)
, .I'm doin' business with both of y'all.

(POINTING TO

DJANGO)
He does the eyeballin', you the billfold?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well you don't make it sound too flattering,
but more or less, yes.
None of the white men in the room have any respect for a white man who
needs a nigger to tell him what time of day it is.
Candie turns his attention back to Django.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO DJANGO)
So Bright Boy,.Moguy here tells me you
looked over my African flesh, and were
none too impressed.

FLASH ON
we see. Django looking over THREE MANDINGOS..









BACK TO CLEO CLUB

DJANGO
Not for top dollar.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well then we got nothing more to talk
about. You wanna buy a beat ass nigger
from me, those are the beat ass niggers
I wanna sell.

DJANGO
He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna
sell. He wants the nigger you don't
wanna sell.

CALVIN CANDIE
I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna
sell.
Dr.Schultz chimes in thoughtfully;-
Dr.SCHULTZ
You won't sell your best. You won't even
sell your second best. But your third
best... .you don't want to.sell him... .But if
I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be
forced to consider it... . who knows what
could happen?

CALVIN CANDIE
What do you consider ridiculous?
Dr.SCHULTZ.
For a truly talented specimen,
."The Right Nigger"..:?
How much would you say, Django?

DJANGO
Twelve thousand dollars.
Calvin Candle takes in the figure.

CALVIN CANDIE
Gentlemen, you had my curiosity. Now
you got my attention.

TIME CUT

TNT -- CLEOPATRA CLUB -- RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Candle, Moguy, Django, Schultz, Bartholomew, Sheba, and Coco eat dinner
in the restaurant. All the men eat thick T-Bones. Coco eats Catfish.
And Sheba uses her fingers to rip apart Crawdads.









77

CALVIN CANDIE
How ya like that meat, Bright Boy?
Django's eyes go to Calvin, he nods his approval.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO COCO)
How's your Catfish, dew drop?

COCO
Real good Monsieur Candie.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
You spend a lot of time around niggers
aside from Freeman here?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Not so much.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well if'in you did,.you'd know what a
treat this was for 'em. You feel special
Coco?

COCO
Yes. sir, Monsieur Candie.

CALVIN CANDIE
You feel special Bartholomew?

BARTHOLOMEW
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
He looks to Sheba, who's licking her fingers from the Crawdads.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now Sheba always feels special. Dont'cha?

SHEBA
Yep.

CALVIN CANDIE
How 'bout you Bright Boy, you feel
special?

DJANGO

(MEANING SHEBA)
Not as special as her.
The table breaks out in laughter.









CALVIN CANDIE
Well we're leaving bright and early
tomorrow morning, and moving the. whole
kit and caboodle to "Candyland."
You oughta come with us.
Dr.Schultz and Django's eyes meet for a moment.. .so far...so good.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, that wasn't on the agenda. But I
suppose I could be amenable to that.
How far must we trek?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh hardly a ride at all, We'll still be
in Chickasaw County. Five hours.. .tops.
There you can get a look at my best
specimens. Have dinner with my sister
and I. Spend the night at Candyland as
my guest.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid.
Django and Schultz trade looks and small smiles.

WE CUT

EXT - COUNTRY SIDE MISSISSIPPI - DAY
It's the next day and a whole procession is making their way to
"Candyland."
Calvin Candie, Leonide Moguy, Dr.Schultz, Django, and THREE OVERSEERS
(BILLY CRASH, TOMMY GILES, and HOOT PETERS) ride horses.
Bartholomew (now dressed in work clothes) drives a buckboard filled
with'supplies.
FIVE MANDINGOS (Big Fred and Banjo who we already met, plus JOSHUA,
SIDNEY JAMES, and TATUM) recently purchased at the Greenville Auction
walk to their new home, with small bundles of their personal
possessions under their arm. They look like powerful warriors.

THREE OTHER SHIRTLESS MANDINGOS (RODNEY, CHICKEN CHARLY, CHESTER) WHO
WERE THE MANDINGOS FROM Candyland that didn't sell at Greenville are
walking back to Candyland, with their small bundle of personal
possessions under their arms. These poor devil's know their fate is
pretty dismal. Either they'll be sold to the LeQuint Dickey Mining
Company, or they'll be put in some mandingo fight they can't win, like
with Samson, or Stonesipher's dogs.









J

RODNEY
walks along the road, looks up at Django riding his horse. All the
slaves hate Django because they think he's a black slaver. But
the three heading back to Candyland are even more resentful.

FLASH ON
Django with Schultz, earlier, inspecting and rejecting these three.

RODNEY
gives Django a bad eyeball look up on his horse.

DJANGO ON TONY
sees it. He's playing the role of a fucker black slaver, he can't let
that shit stand.
He yells down to the powerless man;

DJANGO
Gotta problem with your eyeball, boy?
Rodney looks away.

RODNEY
No sir.

DJANGO
You want a boot heel in it?

RODNEY
No sir.

DJANGO
Then keep ya damn eyeballs off me!
Flash that bad look at me again,
I'll give ya reason not to like me!
As this parade makes progress, Django keeps his emotions in check, but
not without difficulty.
Dr.Schultz comes riding Fritz beside him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
How do you like this side of the slave
trade?

DJANGO
Not so much.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Prefer the other side?

DJANGO
I didn't say that.








Dr.SCHULTZ
I've confirmed Broomhilda's at Candyland.

DJANGO
Are you sure it's her?
Dr.SCHULTZ
He didn't call her by name, but she's a
young lady, whip marks on 'her back, and
speaks German. Now while it's not wise to
assume, in this instance, I think it's
pretty safe.

DJANGO
Did you offer to buy her?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I opened the door to my possible interest.
But naturally, sight unseen, I can only be
so interested.

SUDDENLY ...
Calvin Candie comes riding up behind them...

CALVIN CANDLE
Am I intruding?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Of course not.

CALVIN CANDIE

(APPRAISING THE

TWO MEN)
I swear you two are cozier then a couple
of cuttle fish.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You'd be surprised what a good
conversationalist Django is.

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh by now, I don't think that would
surprise meat all.
Candie gives Django a creepy smile.
Around now the audience may start noticing DOG BARKING in the distance.
Dr.SCHULTZ
When do we reach your property?









1?3

CALVIN CANDLE
You been on it. I own the whole sixty
miles 'fore we get to Candyland.
Candie gets annoyed at the barking dogs.

CALVIN CANDIE
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.

(YELLING BEHIND
him at Billy)
Billy Crash, git up here!
Billy Crash, a hillbilly overseer who's missing his two front teeth,
rides up.

BILLY CRASH
Yeah, Boss?

CALVIN CANDIE
Find out what that goddamn commotion
is up at the tracker shack!

BILLY CRASH
Right away, Boss.
Billy Crash TEARS UP AHEAD on his horse.

CALVIN CANDIE
You know, confidentially, just 'tween
us girls, worse things about this
business, ain't the slaves. It's all
the white trash ya gotta deal with.
Like these peckawoods we got riding with
us. These dumb, ignorant, sleazy sonsabitches
ain't good fer nuttin, except kickin' a
niggers ass can't kick back. Yeah, they
holdin' the pretty part of the whip, but
it's just a thin membrane separate 'em.
And don't think they don't know it either.
It's about the only thing these dumbass
motherfuckers do know. But ya need 'em.
Who the hell else ya gonna get to beat a
niggers ass, other than somebody might as
well be a nigger hisself. But these mountain
boys I use as trackers for the runaways,
they the worst. Nothin but a buncha goddamn
inbreed hillbillies. Now like that nigger
gal we was talkin' 'bout. I'm sure it.was
a pain in the ass, but with a lot of
patience, that German lady taught Hildi
how to speak German.
Django hears her name himself. His head does involuntary jerk, but his
ï¿½, emotions betray nothing.









PTE

CALVIN CANDIE

(CON'T)
Now these inbred hillbillies, on the other
hand, they can barely speak English. I can't
understand a damn word most of 'em say. You
could teach a plow horse how to make a pot
of coffee, 'fore you teach those fools how
to use a knife and fork. I tell ya, if it
wasn't for catchin' a nigger on the run,
they'd be as useless as tits on a boar hog.
Billy Crash comes riding back.

CALVIN CANDIE
What the hell's goin on?

BILLY CRASH
They got 'em a runaway.

CALVIN CANDIE
Who?

CUT TO

EXT - TRACKER SHACK - DAY
A BUNKHOUSE for the FOUR HILLBILLY TRACKERS (they track down runaway
slaves) that live here about forty miles from the Candyland Plantation.
A little dog kennel, looks like a chicken coup, sits next to the
bunkhouse.
The TRACKERS are a hairy, bearded, burly, buck skinned wearing, dirty
long haired lot.
Their Leader is Mr.,STONESIPHER, the other three are STEW, LEX, and
JAKE. The four men could be brothers, or cousins, or father and sons,
or just from the same hollow.
Lex holds two SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERDS on a leash. Stew one SNARLING
GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash. And Mr.Stonesipher holds one SNARLING
GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash, the lead dog, that goes by the name of

MARSHA.
A runaway slave named, D'ARTAGNAN, lies belly down in the dirt,
surrounded by the four vicious dogs, who BARK, GROWL, and SNAP at him.
One look at D'Artagnan tells you he's a mandingo who's been in one
fight too many. One of his eyes have been 'poked out. Big BITES have
been bit out of both his face and neck (by past fights, human bites,
not-the dogs), as well as three fingers have been bit off. Not to
mention he's covered in cuts, like he's been drug through a briar
patch.









O V5
The fourth Tracker, JAKE, doesn't engage in the melodrama. He hangs in
the background, CUTTING FIREWOOD with a big axe.
Calvin Candie, Dr.Schultz, Django, and the whole Candie caravan look
down on the runaway slave. Including the five new mandingos, and the three
old mandingos who know D'Artagnan.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well I'll be, D'Artagnan. Now boy, why do
a fool thing like run off?

D'ARTAGNAN
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh yes you can. You might not be able to
win, but your ass can fight. - Mr.Stonesipher,
shut these goddamn dogs up, I can't hear
myself think!
Mr.Stonesipher, yells to Marsha;
Mr.STONESIPHER
Hush now! Marsha! Marsha, hush up!
Marsha, Marsha, hush up!
(to the other

TRACKERS)
Take these goddamn dogs away from this nigger,
he's just makin' em hungry.
The other two YANK the dogs away from the fallen Black Man.

CALVIN CANDIE
How long was he loose?
Mr. Stonesipher spits tobacco juice.
Mr.STONESIPHER
A.night. Day. Half the other night.

CALVIN CANDIE
How far he git off property?
Mr.STONESIPHER
Bout twenty miles off prop. Pretty fer,
considering that limp he got.

CALVIN CANDIE
Moguy, who was D'Artagnan suppose to fight
Friday?.

MOGUY
(pointing behind him)
One of this new lot.









CALVIN CANDIE
Well the way he looks now a blind Indian
wouldn't bet 'a bead on 'em.

(TO D'ARTAGNAN)
Boy, you done made yourself as useless as
a tail on a teddy bear.
D'Artagnan starts begging.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now now, no beggin', no playin' on my
soft heart. You in trouble now, son.
Now you need to understand I'm runnin' a
business. Now I done paid five hundred
dollars for you. And when I pay five
hundred dollars, I expect to get five
fights outta a nigga 'fore he roll over
and play dead. You've fought three fights.

D'ARTAGNAN
I won every one.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well, yes you did. But that last one, you
muddied the line between winning and losing.
Calvin climbs down off of his horse, and walks to the captured runaway
on the ground.

CALVIN CANDIE
But the fact remains, I pay five hundred
dollars, I want five fights. So what
about my five hundred dollars? You gonna
reimburse me?
The Whites (except for Schultz) laugh.
This whole spectacle is making Dr.Schultz sick to his stomach.
Not Django ... . he's seen this little drama play out many times before.
The three returning mandingos, Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester,
watch their fellow doomed servant pay the price for running away.
The five new mandingos watch Calvin Candie's treatment of D'Artagnan to
know what to expect from their new home.
Bartholomew on the buckboard looks at the captured runaway like, poor
bastard.
Calvin prods further.

CALVIN CANDIE
You even know what reimburse means?









E 17
The Whites laugh.
Then SUDDENLY ...
.The German Speaks;
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'll reimburse you.
All eyes turn to Dr.Schultz.
Including Django's, whose eyes narrow at the doctor.
Calvin Candie uses the occasion to perform a slow dramatic turn in the
direction of the good German.

CALVIN CANDIE
You will?
Removing his long brown leather billfold from his suit jacket pocket.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes.

CALVIN CANDIE
You'll pay five hundred dollars for a
one eyed Ole'Joe, ain't fit to push a
broom?
Django's voice cuts through the Mississippi heat.

DJANGO
No he won't.
All eyes turn to Django.

DJANGO
He's just tired'of you toyin' with him is
all. And for that matter, so am I. But we
ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny,
we ain't got no use for 'em. Ain't that
right, Doc?
Dr.Schultz realizes he's just done the one thing he's always preached
to Django you can never do..BREAK CHARACTER. The doctor puts his
billfold back in his suit coat pocket.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO CANDIE)
You heard 'em.
The Hillbilly Trackers stare up at the black man on the horse in the
green jacket, slack jawed.
!` Even the one chopping wood in the BG stops his chopping.









CALVIN CANDIE
You'll hafta excuse Mr.Stonesipher's slack
jawed gaze. He ain't never seen a nigger
like you ever in his life..Ain't that right,
Mr. Stonesipher?
Mr.. Stonesipher., SPITS.
Mr.STONESIPHER
That's right.
Calvin steps up to Django on his horse. Looking up at the black man,
Calvin challenges Django to a staring contest.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well now since you won't pay a penny for
this pickaninny, you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger however I see fit?

DJANGO
He's your nigger.

CALVIN CANDIE
Mr.Ston.esipher... .let Marsha and her
bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
Mr.STONESIPHER
Marsha...git 'em!
The other Trackers let loose of the leashes holding the German
Shepherds back.
The DOGS CHARGE towards D'Artagnan on his knees...

THE MANDINGOS
all react to the sight of the dogs being let loose.
The DOGS ATTACK D'ARTAGNAN ...
As we HEAR the ATTACK ...
Candie.staring contest with Django...
Django, who expected nothing less and has seen worse, doesn't blink as
the runaway slave is torn to bits by canine teeth ...
The other Mandingos are scared sick at what they see.
The Hillbilly Trackers root the dogs on.
Dr.Schultz has never seen a man torn apart by dogs before, and he
appears not to enjoy it.
Calvin, without blinking, shifts his eyes toward Dr.Schultz, then back
ï¿½-. to Django.









P9

CALVIN CANDIE
Your boss looks a little green around
the gills for a blood sport like
nigger fightin'?
As D'Artagnan's SCREAMS and Marsha's GROWLS continue OFF SCREEN.

DJANGO
Naw, he just ain't use to seein' a man
ripped apart by dogs, is all.

CALVIN CANDIE
But you are use to it?

DJANGO
Well, him bein' German an' all, I'm
a little more use to American's then
he is. Now Monsieur Candie, whenever you're
ready, we rode five hours so you could
show off your stock. Let's git to it.
Cause as of now, if he's a example, I'
ain't impressed.
Calvin...BLINK...
Saying nothing, Monsieur Candie turns his back to Django, climbs up on
his horse, then looks at the black man.

CALVIN CANDIE
Follow me.
The whole caravan rides off as the dogs continue to tear D'Artagnan
apart.

EXT - THE GROUNDS OF CANDYLAND - DAY
The caravan starts to approach Candyland. Calvin Candie and his sister
own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of Mississippi.
As the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton, and fields of SLAVES
picking it.
The audience might of been expecting Candyland to be a hell on earth,
Auschwitz, Andersonville, Yuma Prison, a Mexican prison in a Sergio
Corbucci Spaghetti western ...
INSTEAD ... . CANDYLAND is very beautiful. The fields of cotton, the way
the trees hang green vines over everything. It's full of nature and
natures vibrant colors, and a broiling hot sun to see it all in.
One of the cottonpickers in the field, DOBIE, looks up, and sees Django
in his cool green corduroy jacket, badass cowboy hat, on top of Tony.
He taps the shoulder of another cotton picker (ORWELL), and points out
Django.









90
All of a sudden all the bent over backs in the field, straighten up to
get a better look at the black riding a horse.
Django looks back matching their stare.

EXT - SLAVE VILLAGE - DAY
The caravan rolls through the shack/cabin village the slaves live in.
As the parade rolls through all the SLAVES snap to attention, and bow
(very formally) as Monsieur Candie rides past. A KING among his SUBJECTS,
a PATRON with his PEONS, a FATHER amongst his CHILDREN, a SHEPHERD
among his SHEEP.
KIDS playing in the dirt get up and run to Calvin on his horse.
Candie calls the kids by name, takes out a bag of jelly beans, and
begins tossing them about.
The Kids scramble in the dirt for the bright colored candy.
This is Calvin Candie in his element, at his happiest.

THEN ...
.DJANGO rides by.
The CARAVAN moves from the slave village to the White Village the
overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds.
Other then the switch of white faces for black, it's pretty much the
same village.
And they too see Django ... . WOW!
The Caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the Plantation,
or The Big House as everyone calls it.
To the left of the Big House is big wooden ARENA built for his Friday
night nigger fights.
All the HOUSE SLAVES (the domestic slaves that work for the Candie
family in the Big House), and WHITE WORKERS (overseers and stray farm
hands) come out to greet the caravan.
They all greet Monsieur Calvin Candie, who naturally leads the
procession, as if he's Alexander The Great returning from the wars.
As the caravan comes to a stop in front of the Big House, it creates a
huge dust cloud behind it.
Calvin's widowed sister LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLY, an attractive
ï¿½. fortyish, strawberry blonde southern belle, steps out on the porch of
the Big House to greet her brother.








Directly above Lara Lee, on the third floor balcony over hang, out.
steps...

STEPHEN
eyeing Calvin and the approaching caravan.
Who's STEPHEN? Stephen is a very old black man, who with his bald pate,
and tufts of white curly hair on the sides, looks like a character out
of Dickens - if Dickens wrote about House Niggers in the Antebellum
South. -
Stephen has been Calvin's slave since he was a little boy. And in
(almost) every way is the 2nd most powerful person at Candyland.
Like the characters Basil Rathbone would play in swashbucklers, evil,
scheming, intriguing men, always trying to influence and manipulate power
for their own self interest. Well that describes Stephen to a tee.
The Basil Rathbone of House Niggers.
The old Man watches the caravan and the trailing dust cloud approach.

THEN...
Out of the dust cloud ...EMERGE DJANGO and SCHULTZ... . on TONY and FRITZ.
All the Candylanders see Django, dressed like he is, up on the horse,
and for a moment don't know what to think.
Lara Lee, like her brother, is both surprised and intrigued.
As Stephen peers down from his perch at the nigger in the green jacket,
it's hate at first sight. Stephen heads downstairs, he walks with a,
limp.
All the caravan riders are still up on their horses. Calvin sees
Stephen limping towards them, and greets him with a big how do you do;

CALVIN CANDIE
Hello Stephen my boy!

STEPHEN
Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass - who's
this nigger up on that nag?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh Stephen, why so ornery, you miss me?

STEPHEN
Yeah, I miss you like I miss.a rock in my
shoe. Like I said, who's this nigger, up
on that nag?

DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
Hey Snowball.








: Stephen looks up at Django on Tony.

DJANGO
If you wanna know who I am, or the name of
my horse, you ask me.

STEPHEN
Just'who the hell you callin' Snowball,
horse boy? I'll yank your ass of that
goddamn'nag, so goddamn fast - in the mud.

CALVIN CANDIE
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Stephen, let's keep it
funny. Django's a Freeman.
Stephen jerks a thumb up towards Django.

STEPHEN
This nigger, here?

CALVIN CANDIE
That nigger there. Let me at least introduce
the two of. you. Django, this is another
cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen.
Stephen, this is Django. You two should
hate each other.
Stephen uses'the special privilege he and he alone enjoys amongst the
blacks at Candyland.

STEPHEN
Calvin, who the hell is this nigger you
feel the need to entertain?

CALVIN CANDIE
Django and his friend in grey, Dr.Schultz
are customers, and they are our guests
Stephen. And you - you old decrepit bastard...
.are to show them every hospitality.
Do you understand that?

STEPHEN
I don't know why I gotta -

CALVIN CANDIE
You don't hafta know why, do you
understand?

STEPHEN
Yeah yeah yeah, I understand just fine.

CALVIN CANDIE
Good. They're spending the night. Go up
in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.









93

STEPHEN

(POINTING AT

DJANGO)
He's gonna stay in the Big House?

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different.

STEPHEN

(INCREDULOUS)
In the Big House?

CALVIN CANDIE
You gotta problem with that?

STEPHEN
I don't gotta problem, unless you gotta
problem with burin' the bed, the sheets,
and the pillow cases once this black ass
motherfuckers gone!

CALVIN CANDIE
That's my problem, they're mine to burn.
Your problem, right now, is making a
good impression. And I want you to start
solving that problem right now, and git
them rooms ready.
The Old Man looks up at his Master, and says;

STEPHEN
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
Stephen limps away to the guest rooms, muttering to'himself.
Lara Lee and her ever present shadow, a FAT MAMMY named CORA, comes up
to her brother on his horse.

CALVIN CANDIE
Dr.Schultz, this attractive southern belle
is my widowed sister, may I present to you,
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
Lara Lee does a southern lady bow.
Dr.Schultz lifts his bowler hat, and nods in a grand manner.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I am Dr.King Schultz, this is my 2nd
Django,
(Django tips his hat)
and these are our horses, Fritz and Tony.
Both Fritz and Tony do the head bow.








Dr.SCHULTZ
And it is our great delight to encounter
this flaming rose.

LARA LEE
Well aren't you the charming gentlemen.
You're not from around here, are you?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Actually I'm from a far off land,
Dusseldorf, to be exact.

CALVIN CANDIE
These two are in the market for a fightin'
nigger. So I thought I'd invite 'em down,
show 'em my stock.

LARA LEE
We'll all have dinner tonight, right?

CALVIN CANDIE
Half the reason I invited them. I thought
you'd find.them as intriguing as I do
little sister.
Lara Lee looks up at Django, and smiles.
All of a sudden THREE WHITE RIDERS ride up on horses, a older one, and
two tough looking younger ones. The'older one is the Cap't of the
Overseers, ACE WOODY, and his two assistants BROWN and JINGLE BELLS
CODY. While Ace is dressed for work on a farm, both Brown and Jingle
Bells Cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits.
As Calvin Candie watches the three riders approach, he turns to
Dr.Schultz and Django, and says;

CALVIN CANDIE
You know since I started fightin' niggers
about eleven years ago, it's been a new
lease on'life. And the man ridin' up here
now is the man responsible for all my
success.
Ace and his boys pull their horses up, kicking up dust.
Through the dust Ace, Brown, and Jingle Bells Cody eyeball Django and
Schultz.

CALVIN CANDIE
Howdy Ace.

(TO SCHULTZ

AND DJANGO)
This here is my Overseer .Cap't, and
nigger fight trainer extraordinaire,
Ace Woody.









915
Pointing at the two shadows that flank Ace Woody.

CALVIN CANDIE
And that's Brown and that's Jingle Bells
Cody.

(TO ACE)
Ace, this here is Dr.Ring Schultz, and
Django Freeman, they're big customers with
big pockets wanna buy a big nigger. So I
brought 'em out here so you could give
'em a little display of our African flesh.
Ace takes off his hat, bows from his horse, welcoming them.

ACE WOODY
Welcome to Candyland, gentlemen.
Astride their horses Brown and Jingle Bells Cody just make faces at
Django.
Ace's attention goes to the five new mandingos.just walked from
Greenville to here.

ACE WOODY
These the new chickens?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes siree bob.

ACE WOODY
How many you get?

(HE COUNTS)
One, two, three, four, five.

CALVIN CANDIE
Five real strong bucks.

ACE WOODY
How many you get rid of?

CALVIN CANDIE
We still got three left.
Ace looks to see who came back from the auction.
Leo Moguy chimes in;

MOGUY
I already wired the LeQuint Dickey people,
they'll be here tomorrow.
Ace turns to Brown.









ACE WOODY
Get 'em away from the others. Put 'em in
the pen till tomorrow.
Brown with his horse, yells, chases, and herds the three men away into
the slave pen.
Ace yells from his horse down to the five new mandingo arrivals, Big
Fred, Banjo, Sidney James, Tatum,.and Joshua.

ACE WOODY
Y'all stand over there and make a line!
They do.
Ace climbs down from off his horse.
Cody stays in his saddle, circling the black men with his horse.
Everybody, including Django and Dr.Schultz, watch the show.
Ace'Woody walks up and down the line looking at the new men.
Candie, sitting comfortably up on his horse, says;

CALVIN CANDIE
What do you think?

ACE WOODY
I think you lookin' for niggers to push
a plow, 'dem your boys.
Candie rolls his eyes.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's wrong with them?

ACE WOODY
Hold it...hold it, you done bought
r em, let me look at 'em.
Unimpressed Ace Woody continues to examine them.

ACE WOODY
Okay, how 'bout that one, did you
buy that one?

CALVIN CANDIE
Which one?

ACE WOODY
What you mean, which one? The one I'm
pointing at, that one.









77

CALVIN CANDIE
Actually, that one was purchased by
our mister Moguy.

ACE WOODY

(TO MOGUY)
You bought him?

MOGUY
Yes I did.

ACE WOODY
Why?

MOGUY
I like his prospects.

ACE WOODY
His prospects? Now you know Mr..Moguy,
I ain't a educated fella like yourself.
Remind me again what prospects means?

MOGUY
Hope for the future.
Jerking a thumb towards the slave in question.

ACE WOODY
You got hope for his future?

MOGUY
I did.

ACE WOODY
Well I don't.
Ace walks over to the slave in question.

ACE WOODY
What's your name, boy?
The mandingo says;

SIDNEY JAMES
Sidney James, sir.

ACE WOODY
So long Sidney James.
Ace takes the peacemaker out of the holster on his hip, and SHOOTS
Sidney James point blank in the belly.
Everybody reacts.








Especially the four other mandingos standing next to him.
Sidney James rolls in the dirt, screaming and holding his bleeding gut.
Till Cody puts a bullet in his head, putting him out of his misery.
Moguy, shakes his head, "Typical," he thinks.
Django and Schultz, on their horses next. to Candid, watch.
Ace looks up at his boss.

ACE WOODY
Boss Candie, which one did you buy?

CALVIN CANDIE
Well to me the pick of the litter is
Big Fred over there.

ACE WOODY

(POINTING AT

FRED)
This one over here?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes.

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
You Fred?
A very scared Fred answers.

BIG FRED
Yes, sir.

ACE WOODY
Well good to meet'cha Fred, I'm'Ace Woody,
I'm a man of influence 'round here. Now
Fred am I mistaken, or were you already in
a kurfuffle?

CALVIN CANDIE
I had 'em fight one of Amerigo's niggers
last night.

'ACE WOODY
How is of Amerigo?

CALVIN CANDIE
His nigger lost.









99

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
Really? You won?

BIG FRED
Yes, sir.

ACE WOODY
Wup'ed his ass?

CALVIN CANDIE
Beat 'em to death.
Smiling impressively at Big Fred.

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
Really?

CALVIN CANDIE
He did have fifteen pounds on 'em,
but still, he still beat his ass
to death.

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
You did?

BIG FRED)
Yes, sir.

ACE WOODY
Good job, boy. Got any more wins in ya?

BIG FRED
Yes, sir.
Ace gives Cody a slight head nod, and Cody SHOOTS Big Fred in the back.
Candie acts out mock frustration.
The remaining three mandingos jump a mile.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now why did you do that?

ACE WOODY
He won his last fight last night.
Ace puts his eyes on the three remaining mandingos









1 00

ACE WOODY

(TO MANDINGOS)
Those of you with exceptional ability
will find it ain't so bad here. Those of
you who don't possess exceptional ability,
will wish you did.
Ace looks up to Cody on his horse.

ACE WOODY
Run 'em over to the Arena. Git 'em doin
push ups. First one gives out, shoot 'em
in the head.

(TO MANDINGOS)
Welcome to Candyland, boys!
Cody runs the terrified mandingos to the arena.
Candie leans over to Schultz and says;

CALVIN CANDLE
We only get about two out of every batch
of five fighters we buy. But those two
tend to be lucky.
Ace Woody hops back up on his horse.

CALVIN CANDIE
You know Mr.Woody, I'm beginning to think
that you don't trust my judgement?
Ace Woody just smiles at his boss, and says;

ACE WOODY
Oh you know I always trust your judgement,
Boss Candie...eventually.
He rides off.
Stephen limps back to the action.

CALVIN CANDIE
Ahhh, Stephen my boy, rooms ready?

STEPHEN
All ready for your guest and his nigger.
Candie'shakes his head in mock frustration.

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, you're incorrigible.

(TO SCHULTZ

AND DJANGO)
Gentlemen, let Stephen show you to your
rooms.









/O+

CALVIN CANDLE

(CON'T)
There you can lie down and rest up
for a couple of hours. Then we'll have
some lemonade, and I'll show off some of
my finer specimens.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid.
Both Dr.Schultz and Django climb down from their horses.
Candie looks to a black little stable boy of about eight named TIMMY.

CALVIN CANDIE
Timmy boy, go take their horses for 'em.
Fix 'em up at the stable, give 'em a load
of oats.
Django hands the boy the reigns.

DJANGO
That's Fritz, this is Tony. You take good
care of 'em now.

TIMMY
Yes, sir.
Django takes an apple out of his saddle bag, and hands it to the boy.

DJANGO
Once he's in the stable, give 'em that.
He reaches back in the saddle and pulls out another one.

DJANGO
Give that one to Fritz.
Timmy leads the horses away.
The two visitors start to follow Stephen to their rooms, when
Dr.Schultz pretends to remember something;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, Monsieur Candie, about that matter about
the nigger girl we were talking about?

CALVIN CANDIE
Nigger girl?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I believe you said she spoke German?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh Yes, Hildi, what about her?








,oz.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Do you think before the demonstration you
could send her around to my room?

CALVIN CANDIE
I don't see why not.

(TO STEPHEN)
Stephen, when you get through showing
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi.
I want her cleaned up and smellin' nice,
and sent over to Dr.Schultz's room.
Stephen has to be the bearer of bad news.

STEPHEN
Actually... . Monsieur Candie... . there's
somethin' we ain't tole you yet.

CALVIN CANDIE
What?

STEPHEN
Hildi's in The Hot Box.
This gets Django's, Schultz's, and Candie's attention.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's she doin' there?

STEPHEN
What 'cha think she doin' in The Hot Box,
she bein punished.

CALVIN CANDIE
What she do?

STEPHEN
She ran away again.

CALVIN CANDIE
Jesus Christ, how many people ran away
when I was gone?

STEPHEN
Two.

CALVIN CANDIE
When did she go?

STEPHEN
Last night. They brought her back this
morning.









CALVIN CANDLE
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?
Django's hand falls to the butt of his smoke wagon. If they sicked
those dogs on his angel, he's going to just kill all these
motherfuckers right now.

STEPHEN
Lucky for her they were busy lookin' for
D'Artagnan's ass. Brown and Cody went out
lookin' for her and found her. She a little
beat up, but she did that to herself.
Runnin' through them damn bushes.
Django's hand moves away from his gun.

CALVIN CANDIE
How long she been in the box?

STEPHEN
What'cha think, all goddamn day! Little
fool got ten more days to go.

CALVIN CANDLE
Take her out.

STEPHEN

(INCREDULOUS)
Take her out? Why!

CALVIN CANDLE
Because I said so, that's why. Hildi is
my nigger. Dr.Schultz is my guest. Southern
hospitality dictates I make her available
to him.

STEPHEN
But Monsieur Candie, she just ran away?

CALVIN CANDLE
Jesus Christ Stephen, what's the point of
havin' a nigger speaks German if-you can't
wheel 'em out when you have a German guest?
I realize it's inconvenient. Still, take
her out.
(to Cora and

LARA LEE)
Lara Lee would you and Cora be responsible
for getting her cleaned up and presentable
for Dr.Schultz?
The overseers,'Tommy Giles and Hoot Peters go to The Hot.Box. While
Billy Crash goes to the well to draw a bucket of water.








Django watches them walk to The Hot Box.
Dr.Schultz's eyes shift to Django, to watch him watch this.
Stephen notices Django's interest in both The Hot Box and whoever's
sizzling in it.
The HOT BOX
itself is a large IRON SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CELL DOOR (from Yuma
Prison) built into the ground. They put a key in the lock, and the two
men lift the heavy iron door open.
REVEALING: A naked Broomhilda broiling in a small coffin like iron box
dug into the ground.
Broomhilda reacts to the sudden burst of blinding sunshine.

WHEN ...
Billy Crash TOSSES the bucket of water on her.
Django watches this.
DJANGO'S POV:.From his wide shot perspective we see them yank the NAKED
BROOMHILDA (incoherent) out of the hole.

REVENGE MUSIC PLAYS
as we move into a Sergio Leone CU of DJANGO'S FACE.
Stephen breaks the mood.

STEPHEN

(TO DJANGO)
You comin', or you wanna sleep in that
little box?
Django turns his back on the naked Broomhilda and follows Stephen and
Dr.Schultz up the front steps of The Big House.

INT - THE BIG HOUSE - DAY
Stephen leads the two guests up the big prominent sweeping staircase in
the entry way of The Big House. Then down the hallway with the guest
rooms. Dr.Schultz is shown his guest room by Stephen. Schultz enters
the room and shuts the door behind him. Stephen takes Django to the
room next door, opens the door, and leads him in.

INT - DJANGO'S GUEST ROOM - DAY
A guest room with a big feather bed, dresser drawer with a flowery
pitcher of water and basin on top of it. A little bedside table with a
lamp and a tiny bell on it.









105

STEPHEN
This one's yours, boy. That bed's damn
nice too.
Django walks over to the window, parts the curtains and peers out.
Broomhilda's gone. As he looks through the glass, snotty Stephen
rattles on in the background.

STEPHEN
Feel free to touch anything you want,
cause we burnin' all this shit once you
gone. I'll have somebody knock on the
door when the demonstration ready.
Django sits down on the bed.
Stephen turns to leave.

DJANGO
Not so fast.

STEPHEN
I got more important things to do then
jaw with you.

DJANGO
Nigger, when I say stop you plant roots.
Both the words and the tone stop Stephen dead. He turns around.

DJANGO
This tiny bell on this little table...
.is this for you? I ring this, you
do fer me?

STEPHEN
Me or somebody.
Django reaches over and picks up the bell.
(a soft) DING-A-LING

STEPHEN

(UNAMUSED)
What 'cha want?

DJANGO
I want you to pour some water in that
bowl for my wash up.
Stephen does what he's told, but with attitude.









)O'
Django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone.
Once Stephen's done, Django stands up from the bed.

DJANGO
Gimmie.
Stephen hands him the basin full of water.
Django takes it from him.
Then throws the water in Stephen's face.
The dripping wet old slave can do nothing against this free man.

DJANGO
Whatsamatter Stephen, you don't like
that?
Django takes his hand and SLAPS the old man hard across the face
knocking him to the floor;

DJANGO
That's my kinda bell ringin'. Git up.
The old man timidly, slowly, and shaky rises off the floor - as soon as
he does - Django SLAPS HIM TO THE FLOOR again.
Then Django sits back down on the bed, looking at the old man on the
floor below his knees.

DJANGO
I've known me House Niggers like you my
whole life. Play your dog tricks with your
Massa'. Ya' lip off to him every now an'
then, as long as ya' keep it funny. He
rolls his eyes and puts up with it, and
all the white folks think it's so cute.
Meanwhile you got all these niggas round
here hoppin' and jumpin' to stay on your
good side. Well this time Snowball, you
gonna listen to me. You got anymore sass
you wanna sling my way, before they give
us a mandingo demonstration, I'm gonna
give this whole motherfuckin plantation
a demonstration, of ME beatin' the BLACK
off your ass. I will make you drop your
drawers, I'll take off my belt, and I will
Wup' your bare ass with it, in front of
every nigga on this plantation. And after
I do that, let's see you play the rooster
round here.









X07

STEPHEN
Calvin wouldn't. let you do it.

DJANGO
Oh that's right, he gives you first name
privileges... . ain't that cute. Sass me
me again nigger, see what happen'.
Stephen lying on the floor, bites his tongue.

DJANGO
That's what I thought. Now git outta"here.
With as much dignity as he can muster, Stephen stands up.
Before he leaves, Django tells him;,

DJANGO
When I ring this bell, you better come
a runnin'. You - not nobody else. While
I'm on this property, you my nigger
Snowball.
Stephen leaves.
Django lies down on the bed. He covers his eyes with his arm.
A door joins Django and Schultz's room. The adjoining door opens, and
Schultz stands there.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Was that wise?
Django doesn't remove his arm from.his eyes.

DJANGO
He ain't tellin' nobody 'bout that.
That's all that needs to be said.

INT - HALLWAY (BIG HOUSE) - DAY
Lara Lee, Cora, and a traumatized, but cleaned up (she's dressed in a
domestic maid uniform) Broomhilda stand outside Dr.Schultz's door,
after Calvin's sister raps on it.
Dr.Schultz opens the door.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Hello ladies.









DOG

LARA LEE
Dr.Schultz, may I introduce to you,
Hildi. Hildi, this is Dr.Schultz, he
speaks German.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO BROOMHILDA)
I've been informed you do as well.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
It would be my, pleasure to speak with you
in German.
Schultz acts for the benefit of Miss Lara's astonishment.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Astonishing.

(IN GERMAN)
Please come inside Fraulein.
She does, and just'as Lara Lee is to say something, Schultz says,
"Thank You very much," and closes the door in her face. Miss Lara looks
to her Mammy, and the two women head off nonplussed.

INT - SCHULTZ'S GUEST ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - LATE AFTERNOON
With the door closed, Schultz turns to the weak, frightened,
disoriented girl.
He gives her a pleasant smile.
Dr.SCHULTZ
They call you Hildi, but your real name
is Broomhilda, isn't it?

BROOMHILDA
Yes. How do you know that?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Stands to reason who ever taught you
German would also give you a German name.
Can I pour you a glass of water,
Broomhilda?
Hearing her name being spoke properly for the first time in awhile, not
to mention with a German accent, does have a bit of a calming influence
on the frightened girl.









107

WE CUT TO DJANGO
on the other side of the adjoining door, listening, waiting for his cue
to present himself.
BACK TO BROOMHILDA AND Dr.SCHULTZ
As Dr.Schultz calmly pours the young lady a glass of water, he begins
talking to her in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
I'm aware you haven't spoken German in
a long while. So I'll talk slowly.
I'm only speaking German to you now,
Broomhilda, in case Candie's people are
listening to us. Myself and a mutual
friend of ours, have gone through a lot
of trouble, and rode a lot of miles, to
find you fraulein - to rescue you.
He hands her a tall clear glass of water.
She looks at him weird, rescue me?
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Please drink.
She absentmindedly obeys.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(.GERMAN).
Now it's myself and our mutual friend's
intention to take you away from here
forever.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
I don't got any friends.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Yes you do.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
Who?
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
I can't tell you. Our mutual friend has a
flair for the dramatic, and he wants to
surprise you.









!!0

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
Where is he?
He points at the adjoining door.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Standing right behind that door.
Her head moves in the direction of the door.
He looks to the young woman;
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Promise me you won't scream?
She nods her head, yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Say, I promise.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
I promise.
Dr.Schultz moves to the door, and lightly raps on it.
The door knob turns.
The door slowly opens revealing...
Her husband Django, but different, all cowboyed out and cleaned up.
He smiles at her, and says;

DJANGO
Hey Little Trouble Maker.
Obviously a pet name between them.
Broomhilda goes into a bit of shock...
.first she loses strength in her wrist, so the glass tips over, and
the water spills on the floor ...
.followed quickly by herself spilling on the floor in a dead. faint.









1/1
The two men look at the woman on the floor, then at each other;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You silver tongued devil you.

MONTAGE
WE DISSOLVE to later, as we see Dr.Schultz and Django explain what-
they're doing there, who they're pretending to be, and what their plan
is to Broomhilda. We hear a woman whistle a soft pretty tune on the
soundtrack. It's not a happy tune.. .per se. But it's pretty, and
vaguely optimistic ...
WE DISSOLVE TO The SLAVE PEN
The doomed men who didn't sell at Greenville, brooding Rodney and
Chester and Chicken Charly, spend their last night at Candyland
sleeping under the stars in The Slave Pen. The same whistling tune
continues over this scene.
Rodney sees, The whole slave selling and buying group, Django,
Dr.Schultz, Candie, Bartholomew, Moguy, Ace Woody, Brown and Cody, and
the Overseers, walk across the plantation grounds on their way to
The Arena. Laughin' and joshin' all the way. The hatred Rodney feels
for that group of men burns inside him like a red hot poker.
A study in powerless fury.

DISSOLVE TO BROOMHILDA SETTING THE DINNER TABLE
in the dining room of The Big House with its knives, spoons and forks.
She's all by herself as she goes through this duty.
The whistling tune we've been listening to has been coming from
Broomhilda whistling as she sets the table.
Suddenly out of the darkness of the background appears Stephen.

STEPHEN
What you. whistlin', girl?
Broomhilda stops whistling and spins surprised in Stephen's direction.

STEPHEN
What was you whistlin'?

BROOMHILDA
Oh nuttin'.

STEPHEN
You weren't whistlin' nothin', you were
whistlin' somethin'. What'cha whistlin'?

BROOMHILDA
I dunno. Somethin' I heard. I don't know
no.name.









)/Z

STEPHEN
It's kinder pretty.
She doesn't say anything in return.

STEPHEN
That was a compliment.

BROOMHILDA
Thank you.
Stephen steps out of the shadows into the light closer to Broomhilda.

STEPHEN
I'm just sayin', two days ago you wus' in
such misery here, you hadda run off. So you
run off, we catch your ass an' drag you back.
Then we stick your bare ass to sizzle in
The Hot Box for' 'bout ten hours. Now here
you are two days later, whistlin' while you
work. I'm just sayin', I.wouldn' think you'd
have a hellva lot to whistle 'bout.
.I'm jus' sayin'.
He watches the effect his words have on Broomhilda's face.

BROOMHILDA
I'm done here, may I be excused?

STEPHEN
Yes you may.
She moves off to another part of the house.
He watches her shuffle off.

INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
Later that evening, Django and a lot of other white people (Calvin
Candie, Lara Lee, Moguy, and Dr.Schultz) sat around the dinner table.
They are being served by the black people we've come to know at
Candyland (Stephen, Cora, and because Dr.Schultz likes her Broomhilda).
Along with an army of DOMESTIC SLAVES acting as wait service.
Knowing Django's a slaver, and for his dinner table privileges, the
Domestic Slaves despise Django.
Even Broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver, even
though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade.
We pick up the conversation in mid-negotiation.









"5.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Look Monsieur Candle, they were all fine
specimens, no doubt about it. But the
best three, by far, were Sampson, Goldie,
and Eskimo Joe. - By the way, why's he
called Eskimo Joe?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh you never know how these nigger nicknames
get started. His name was Joe-...maybe one
day he said he was cold.. .who knows?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Irregardless, we all know Samson's your
best, and you'll never sell him and I can
see why, he's a champion.

CALVIN CANDIE
All three are champions.
Django contradicts, as he chews his steak;

DJANGO
Samson's the champion. The other two
are pretty good.
All the Domestic Slaves around the table STIFFEN at witnessing Django
contradict Calvin Candie.
Including Broomhilda, who's wielding the Gravy Boat. After Django says
that, while in shock, she over pours beef gravy on Lara Lee's mashed
potatoes.

LARA LEE
Hildi!
Broomhilda snaps back.
Instead of getting angry, Candle seems to reflect on that analysis,
then issues his own appraisal;

CALVIN CANDIE
Can Eskimo Joe whip Sampson, no. Can he
take Goldie, probably not - Goldie's the
best dirty fightin' nigger I ever saw. But as
long as you don't put 'em up against those
two., Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass.

DJANGO
Maybe.
The Domestics FREEZE for a jerky second when Django says that.









//

F
Dr.SCHULTZ
You must understand, Monsieur Candie, while
admittedly a .neophyte in the nigger fight
game, I do have a bit of a background in
the European traveling circus. Hence, I
have big ideas when it comes to presentation.
I need something more then just a big nigger.
He needs to have panache. A sense of showmanship.
I want to be able to . bill. him as. The Black Hercules.
I said., and I quote; "I would pay top dollar
for the, right nigger." Now I'm not saying
Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger - per se ...
but is he right as rain ... ?
Everyone waits for Calvin's response. He milks the moment by taking a
sip of his mint julep, then says;

CALVIN CANDIE
Dr.Schultz, i will have you know, there
is no one in the nigger fight game that
appreciates the value of showmanship
more then, Monsieur Calvin J. Candie. But
one must not forget the most important
thing in the nigger fight game.

(BEAT)
A nigger that can win fights. That should
be your first, second, third, four, and
fifth concern. After you have that, and
you know you have that, then, you can
start to implement a grande design. But
since I enjoy oldest man 'at the table
status - beating Moguy by one year for
that honor allow the old sage to advise,
first things first.
Broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans.
Dr.Schultz says something pleasant to her in German..
She smiles, and says something pleasant back.

CALVIN CANDIE
I see you two gettin' on?
Dr.Schultz breaks into a wide grin;
Dr.SCHULTZ
.Famously.

(DRAMATIC PAUSE)
Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what
it's like not to hear you native tongue
for four years.

CALVIN CANDIE
Hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.









Â»5
Everybody at the table chuckles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I can't express the joy I felt conversing
in my mother tongue. And Broomhilda is a
charming conversation companion.
As Broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for Moguy, Lara Lee notices
how Django and Broomhilda look and try not to look at each other.
Stephen enters the room with a fresh mint julep for Monsieur Candie.

LARA LEE
I don't know doctor, you can lay on all
the German sweet talk you want, but it
looks like this ponys got big eyes for
Django.
Lara Lee has no idea how right she is, but when she said it, all three,
Django, Broomhilda, and Schultz, involuntarily jerk.

AND ...
.STEPHEN sees it.
Schultz covers the jerk with more of his verbal gobbilty gook.
Except for Stephen, no one else was the wiser.
Broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for the
kitchen.
Stephen watches her go, then looks at Django, then hands Candie his
mint julep, and goes into a broad routine for the table's benefit.

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, you're amazing. I haven't finished
a drink in this house in twenty years.

STEPHEN
When a man likes a cold drink, a man likes
a COLD drink.
Chuckle... . chuckle...

CALVIN CANDIE
Did you overhear that joke I said about
me spending two weeks in Boston

STEPHEN

(MOCK INDIGNANT)
You don't have any idea the work I do
to see food gets on the table.









1/6

CALVIN CANDIE
What does that hafta do with the price of
Tea in China?

STEPHEN
You think when I'm in that kitchen, I got
nothin' better to do then listen in here
to you tellin' unfunny jokes?
Chuckle... . chuckle...

CALVIN CANDIE

(MOCK INDIGNATION)
What? They laughed!

STEPHEN
Of course they laughed, their parents
raised them right. When they're a guest
in somebody's house, and the master of
of the house thinks he's- funny, you
suppose to laugh. They'd be rude not to.
Chuckle... .chuckle...
They play their little comedy routine for all it's worth.

CALVIN CANDIE
No it was really funny,

(TO TABLE)
wasn't it?

STEPHEN
Now what do you expect these people to
say? What you need to do is stop
embarrassing your guest.

(TO TABLE)
Everybody don't laugh at him, you're being
polite, I understand, you mean well, but
it just encourages him.
Chuckle-chuckle...
As the white folks chuckle, Stephen moves back into the kitchen.

TNT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
Once Stephen enters the kitchen, his smile melts away, and he locks
eyes on Broomhilda. He moves over to her.

STEPHEN
You know that nigger?
/ï¿½ She spins around.









11 7

BROOMHILDAÂ€¢
Who?

STEPHEN
Don't stall me bitch, you know who?

BROOMHILDA
At the table? I don't know him.

STEPHEN.
You don't know him?

BROOMHILDA
No.

STEPHEN
You wouldn't lie to me now, would you?
She shakes her head, no.
Stephen looks at her skeptical.

STEPHEN
Okay, if you say so.

BACK TO DINNER TABLE
Pick it up again in mid-negotiation.

DJANGO
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt
about it. But if it was my money, I
wouldn't pay twelve thousand dollars
for him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What would your price be?

DJANGO
Well, if I ,was inclined to be generous,.
and I don't know why I would be inclined
to be generous... . nine thousand ... . maybe.
Candie's lawyer chimes in.

MOGUY
But the real question is, not how much
he cost, but how much he can earn?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django?

DJANGO
In a years time, seven or eight fights -
outside of Mississippi - where his Candyland
pedigree weren't well known - Virginia...

(CON'T)









11Y

DJANGO

(CON'T)
Georgia -- all goes well ...twenty to twenty
one thousand dollars.

CALVIN CANDIE
Precisely Bright Boy, good on ya. Any way
you cut that cake, that spells profit.
Not to, mention a years worth of action at
the big table in a blood sport with a
winner nigger. However let me reclarify
how this whole negotiation came about.
It wasn't me who came to you to sell a
nigger, it was you who approached me to
buy one. Now that nine thousand dollar
figure Bright Boy was banding about,
ain't too far off from right. And if I
wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, I
could sell 'em any day of the week.
But like you said in Greenville doctor,
I don't wanna sell 'em. It was only your
ridiculous offer of twelve thousand
dollars that would make me consider it.
Dr.Schultz considers'Calvin Candie's words, then suddenly says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You know Monsieur Candie... . you do possess
the power of persuasion.
Candie smiles at that remark.
Then SUDDENLY Schultz SLAPS the table hard with his hand, and says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Why not! Monsieur Candie, you have a deal,
Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!
The White people at the table get very happy.
Dr.Schultz continues;
Dr.SCHULTZ
However, that is a tremendous amount of
money. And the way you have your Mr.Moguy,
I have a lawyer, a persnickety man named
Tuttle. And I would need my man to draw
up a legal contract before I would feel
comfortable exchanging that amount of
money for flesh. Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my
choosing. So say I return in about five
days time with my Mr.Tuttle. And then my
Mr.Tuttle and your Mr.Moguy can hash out
the finer points between themselves.









117

CALVIN CANDIE
Splendid.

(CALLING TO

THE KITCHEN)
Stephen, time for dessert!
Stephen, Cora, Broomhilda, and the other Domestics come out of the
kitchen to clear away the dirty dishes.
Broomhilda goes to Calvin.

BROOMHILDA
Can I take away your dishes, Monsieur Candle?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes you may, Hildi.
She begins gathering the dirty dishes.
Candie looks up at her as she works.

CALVIN CANDIE
So Hildi, how you like servin at the big
table in the big house?

BROOMHILDA
I like it a lot Monsieur Candle.

CALVIN CANDIE
It's a lot better then sizzling in that
hot box, or draggin' your ass through a
bramble bush, ain't it?

BROOMHILDA
Yes 'em.
With Candie interrogating Broomhilda, Django tenses up.
Stephen clocks this.
Stephen decides to test Django's reaction.

STEPHEN
You know Monsieur Candle, the doctor might
be interested in seein' Hildi's "peeled"
back. Seein' as he don't see many niggers
where he from.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
When you was alone with Hildi here, didja
just speak German, or did ya git her
clothes off?









!20
Dr.SCHULTZ
We just spoke.

CALVIN CANDIE
So you haven't seen her back?
Dr.SCHULTZ
No I haven't.

CALVIN CANDIE
Then Stephen's right, you would probably
find this interesting. Hildi, take off
your dress, and show us your back.
Django hears this.
Broomhilda instinctively shoots a look to Django.
Stephen clocks it.

LARA LEE
Calvin, I just got her all dressed up
and looking nice.

CALVIN CANDIE
But Lara Lee, Dr.Schultz is from Dusseldorf,
they don't got niggers there. And he's a
man of medicine. I'm sure it would
fascinate him, the niggers endurance for
pain. I mean Hildi got something like
fifteen lashes on her back. Lara Lee get
one, she'd lose her mind. These niggers
are tough, no doubt about it.

LARA LEE
Calvin, we are eating - dessert, no less.
Ain't no one wanna see her whipped up back.
Django continues to watching this play out.
Stephen watches him.
Candie folds.

CALVIN CANDIE
Okay okay Lara. Maybe after dinner.
During the brandies.
Broomhilda - dismissed - takes Calvin's dishes and heads back into the
kitchen.
Stephen takes one more look at Django, and follows Broomhilda behind
the kitchen door.









121

INT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
In the kitchen with the OTHER DOMESTICS, Stephen says to Broomhilda;

STEPHEN
I thought you said you didn't know him?
Broomhilda turns around.

BROOMHILDA
Huh?
Stephen approaches her, the other Domestics get quiet and watch.

STEPHEN
I said, you said, you didn't know him?

BROOMHILDA
I don't.

STEPHEN
Yes you do.

BROOMHILDA
Mister Stephen, I don't.

STEPHEN
Why you lyin to me?
As tears begin to well in her eyes.

BROOMBILDA
I ain't.

STEPHEN
Why you cryin'?

BROOMHILDA
Because you're scarin' me.

STEPHEN
Why am I scarin' you?

BROOMHILDA
Because you're scary.
Things have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen, that the dinner
table conversation begins to bleed inside.
We hear Dr.Schultz in the next room say;
Dr.SCHULTZ (OS)
.to speak German,with Hildi this
afternoon was positively soul enriching.
Stephen hears this, he's starting to get the idea.









1ZL
His eyes to to Broomhilda.

STEPHEN
You, stay in the kitchen.
Stephen moves to the kitchen door, swings it open, and watches
Dr.Schultz prepare to proposition Candie for Broomhilda. Stephen knows
these two jokers (Django and Schultz) are up to something, and now he's
just figured it out.

INT - DINNER TABLE (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
Dr.SCHULTZ
You indicated earlier you would be
willing to part with Hildi?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes siree bob I did.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well in that case allow me to propose
another proposition?
In full "Ole Jimmie" performance, Stephen BARGES in the room,
INTERRUPTING Dr.Schultz.

STEPHEN
- Monsieur Candie?

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, you just interrupted Dr.Schultz.

STEPHEN
(to Dr.Schultz)
Oh, I do apologize, doctor. My hearin'
ain't worth a damn these days.

(TO CANDIE)
Monsieur Candie, I need a word with you in
the kitchen.

CALVIN CANDIE
What, you mean get outta my chair?

STEPHEN
If you could manage it. It's about dessert.

CALVIN CANDIE
What about dessert?

STEPHEN
I would rather tell you in private.

CALVIN CANDIE
We're having rhubarb pie, what sort of
melodrama could be brewing back there?









123
Stephen bends down and whispers in his ear;

STEPHEN
Meet me in the library.
Well that's a horse of a different color. That means whatever Stephen
has to say, hasn't anything to do with rhubarb pie. "Meet me in the
library" is their secret signal.

CALVIN CANDIE
Fine friend Stephen, I'll be along momentarily.
Stephen exits.
Candie stands up from his chair and addresses the table.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well as you can see, talented no doubt as
they are in the kitchen, from time to
time, adult supervision is required.
If you'll excuse me a moment.
Candie exits.

TNT - LIBRARY (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
A masculine sanctuary for Calvin Candie. Walls of perfectly bound
books. Stuffed animal heads (deer, boar) that he's shot, sit mounted on
the walls. There's comfy red leather chairs and a bar in the globe.
When WE CUT TO this room, we cut to Stephen sitting in one of the red
leather chairs, drinking a brandy out of a brandy sifter.
Calvin enters the room, sees Stephen sitting in the chair, drinking his
brandy, and doesn't bat an eye. It appears, in this room, Calvin's and
Stephen's life long friendship exits on a different plane. Outside of
outside eyes, in this room, all pretense of master and slave is
dropped, and the number one and number two.. men of Candyland can talk
turkey.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's the matter?

STEPHEN
Those motherfuckers ain't here to buy no
mandingos. They want that girl. -

CALVIN CANDIE
What the hell you talkin' about?

STEPHEN
They playin your ass for a fool, that's
what I'm talkin' bout. They ain't here
for no muscle bound Jimmie, they here for
that girl.









CALVIN CANDIE
What girl, Hildi?

STEPHEN
Yeah, Hildi. The niggers know each other.

CALVIN CANDIE
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

STEPHEN
Did he give you any money?

CALVIN CANDIE
Well not yet, but -

STEPHEN
- Then he didn't R ..Y diddly, not yet no
how. But he was just about to buy, who he
came here to buy, when I interrupted him.
Thank you Stephen - you're welcome Calvin.

CALVIN CANDIE
Where you gettin' all this? Why would they
go through all that trouble, to. buy a
nigger with a chewed up back, ain't worth
five hundred dollars?

STEPHEN
Well they're doin' it cause Django's in
love with Hildi. She's probably his wife.
Now why that German gives a fuck about
who that uppity son-of-a--bitch is in love
with, I'm sure I don't know.

CALVIN CANDIE
If she's who they want, why the whole
snake oil pitch about mandingos?

STEPHEN
Because you wouldn't pay no never mind
to four hundred dollar. But twelve
thousand got you real friendly.
Calvin thinks ...
.as per usual, Stephen's right.

CALVIN CANDIE
Those lyin' goddamn.time wastin'
sonsabitches!

(LOUDER)
Sonsabitches! You just watch, I'm gonna
fix their wagon but good! Stephen, we
.gonna have us a Candyland tar and
feathering!









FL5

STEPHEN
Now Calvin.. .not that I wouldn't enjoy
seein' something like that ... . but why
don't you sit down and let's talk about this.

CALVIN CANDLE
I let a goddamn nigger and nigger lovin'
huckster insinuate themselves at my
dinner table, and play this whole goddamn
plantation for a fool!

STEPHEN
Calm-the-fuck-down, sit down, and let's
discuss this.
A frustrated Calvin finally collapses in the chair.

STEPHEN
Now look, you knew, and I knew, there
was something up with these two. We just
didn't know what. But now we do. They
don't want you to know how bad they want
that girl. But these ole boys have rode
a lotta miles, went t6 a whole lotta
trouble, and done spread a whole lotta
bull to get this girl. They must want her
mighty bad. Way I see it, ain't nothin'
changed. They wanna buy a nigger, you
wanna sell a nigger.The only thing done
changed is the advantage.

(BEAT)
Now we got it. .So let's go back in there
and busts these motherfucker's chops.

INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
The Dinner Table Guests listen to Lara Lee'Candie-Fitzwilly hold court
melodramatically ... . Till ... . Calvin Candie enters the room from the
kitchen door.
Lara Lee, oblivious to her brothers change in demeanor, blurts out upon

SEEING HIM;

LARA LEE
There you are! I was beginning to think
you and that of crow ran off together.
Schultz and Django feel the change in their host's demeanor, as he
stares down the table at them.

CALVIN CANDLE
That'd be a hellva note, wouldn't it
Lara Lee?

(CON'T)

CALVIN CANDIE

(CON'T)
Lara Lee, I just looked out the big winda.
Ace Woody's out there dealin' with some
shady slaver sellin' a passel of Ponys.
Would you be a dear and go out there and
give them gals an eyeball. That of boy
knows everything to know 'bout mandingos,
But he don't know diddly 'bout black puddin'.
Lara Lee excuses herself and leaves the room, as she goes out,
Bartholomew, with his Sawed Off Shotgun, comes.in behind Schultz and
Django.

CALVIN CANDIE
Can I ask you two gentlemen to look over
your shoulder?
Schultz and Django do, and see Bartholomew with his sawed off shotgun
pointing at them.
Calvin Candie removes his arm from behind his back, and in his hand
he's holding a big ugly hammer.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now lay your palms flat on the table top.
They put their palms on the table.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now you lift those palms off that turtle
shell table top, Bartholomew gonna let
loose with both barrels of that sawed off.
There's been a lotta lies said around this
table tonight-but that.. .you can believe.

(BEAT)
Mr.Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect
the pistols hangin' on those boys'hips?
Mr.Moguy does.
Holding the hammer in his hand, Candie continues to hold court.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now where were we? Oh yes, I do believe you
were just getting ready to make me a
proposition to buy Broomhilda. Right?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Right.

CALVIN CANDIE

(YELLING TO

STEPHEN)
Stephen! Bring out Hildi!








Ix?
Stephen enters the dining room through the kitchen door, holding
roughly in his grip, Broomhilda. He holds a small Derringer pistol
against the side of her head.
Django and Schultz react.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now it should be quite clear by now I know
you're not here to buy no mandingos.
Reason y'all came to Candyland, is y'all
want Broomhilda. But y'all don't want me
to know how much you want 'er. So instead,
you waste my time with all this Eskimo Joe
horseshit.

(TO STEPHEN)
Stephen, put her in that chair.
Stephen sits the young lady down in Moguy's old chair.
With their palms against the table, unarmed, Django and Schultz
silently watch Candie's next move.
Candie, still holding the hammer, continues.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now the way I see it, ain't nothin' changed..
You still wanna buy a nigger, I still wanna
sell one. So, with that in mind, in Greenville,
Dr.Schultz, you yourself said, "For the Right
Nigger you'd be willing to pay what some would
consider a ridiculous amount." To which, me
myself said, "What is your definition of
ridiculous?" To which you said, "Twelve
thousand dollars."
Now considering you two have ridden a whole
lotta miles, went to a whole lotta trouble,
and done spread a whole lotta bull, to
purchase the lovely lady to my left, it would
appear that Broomhilda is, "The Right Nigger."
And if y'all wanna leave Candyland with
Broomhilda, the price is twelve thousand dollars.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I take it you prefer the take it or leave
it style of negotiating.
Candie continuing to hold the hammer continues.

CALVIN CANDIE
Under the laws of Chickasaw County,
Broomhilda is my property. And I can do
anything with my property I so desire.
He brings the big hammer down hard on the dinner table, making
everybody jump.









IN

CALVIN CANDIE
And if you think my price for this nigger
is too steep, what I'm gonna desire to do
is, take this hammer and beat her ass to
death with it. Right in front of both y'all.
He SMASHES the arm rest of the chair Broomhilda's sitting in.

CALVIN CANDIE
Put up or shut up, Schultz. You wanna save
this nigger bitch, you gonna pay my price.
Dr.SCHULTZ
May I lift my hands from the table top in
order to remove my billfold?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes you may.
Dr.Schultz removes his long brown leather billfold from his gray suit
jacket, and says;,
Dr.SCHULTZ
Easy come, easy go.
He slides the billfold down the table to Candie. The plantation owner
takes out the money, does a quick count, then looks down the table at
the seated Schultz, and says;

CALVIN CANDIE
Pleasure doin' business with you.

TIME CUT

INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
INSERT: Calvin signing over Broomhilda's BILL OF SALE.
.Moguy signs as a witness.
Broomhilda stands next to Django, and watches her Master sign her
freedom papers.
Dr.Schultz sits off by himself. He's very disturbed.
All the white people with Calvin Candie are happy and celebrate
Candie's successes with glasses of Brandy. Lara Lee, Ace Woody, and
Brown and Cody have joined the' celebration.
For an experienced horsetrader, the just concluded transaction is a
thing of legend. He just sold a Pony, with a tore up back, and a
runaway "r" burned in her cheek - ain't worth five hundred
dollars- for twelve thousand.








Stephen smiles and laughs it up with everybody else.
The Other domestics bring out little plates of rhubarb pie, and buzz
around pouring coffee for the white people.
Candie walks over to the seated Schultz, he carries a small plate of
rhubarb pie with him.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
Rhubarb pie?
Schultz looks at the pie and the man.
Dr.SCHULTZ
No.

CALVIN CANDIE
Are you brooding 'bout me getting the best
of ya?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Actually, I was thinking of that poor
devil you fed to the dogs today, D'Artagnan.
And I was wondering what Dumas would make of
all this.
Calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs. Broomhilda's
bill of sale, and her freedom papers. As he says the following he
examines he papers.

CALVIN CANDIE
Dumas...?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Alexander Dumas. He wrote "The Three Musketeers."
I figured you must be an admirer. You named
your slave after that novel's lead character.
If Alexander Dumas had been there today, I
wonder what he would of made of it?

CALVIN CANDIE
You doubt he'd approve?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes his approval would be a dubious proposition
at best.

CALVIN CANDIE
Soft hearted Frenchy?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Alexander Dumas is black.









1 30
Schultz rises, puts the papers in his back pocket, .looks to his two
companions, Django and Broomhilda, and says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
We got it, let's go.

(TO CANDIE)
Normally Monsieur Candie, I would say,
auf wiedersehen. But since what auf wiedersehen
actually means is, till I see you again,
and since I never wish to see you again,
to you sir, I say, goodbye.
Schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit.
When Calvin says to the German's back;

CALVIN CANDIE
One more moment, Doc!
Dr.SCHULTZ
What?

CALVIN CANDIE
It's a custom here in the South, once a
business deal is concluded, for the two
parties to shake hands. It implies good
faith.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm not from the South.
He turns to leave.

CALVIN CANDIE
You're in my house, doctor, I'm afraid
I must insist.
This turns Schultz around.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Insist what...? That I shake your hand
before I leave? Then I'm afraid I must
insist in the opposite direction.
Calvin walks closer to the German doctor.

CALVIN CANDIE
You know what I think you are?
Dr.SCHULTZ
What you think I am? No I don't.









1310,

CALVIN CANDLE
I think you are a bad loser.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And I think you're an abysmal winner.

CALVIN CANDLE
Never the less, here in Chickasaw County
a deal ain't done till the two parties have
shook hands. Even after all this paper
signin', don't mean shit you don't shake my hand.
Dr.SCHULTZ
If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw
away twelve thousand dollars...?
I don't think so.
Schultz looks to Django and Broomhilda.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Let's go.

CALVIN CANDIE
Bartholomew, if she tries to leave here
before this German shakes my hand.
Cut 'er down.
Schultz looks to Django... . then to Candle..
.and then with a smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye, asks

CANDLE;
Dr.SCHULTZ.
You really want me to shake your hand?
Django gets it.

CALVIN CANDIE
I insist.

DR
-Schultz smiles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, if you insist.
Django goes to stop him...









1 714
The German crosses toward Candie, offering him his hand...
Candie offers his hand to Schultz...
The small DERRINGER POPS into Schultz's outstretched hand...

POP!
He SHOOTS CALVIN CANDIE in the heart.
Candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart, and he
falls to the floor.
Everybody is stunned.
Schultz looks to Django.
Django looks back.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO DJANGO)
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.
Dr.SCHULTZ is BLOWN APART by Bartholomew's SAWED OFF SHOTGUN.
The room comes to its senses and attacks Django and Broomhilda.

FADE TO BLACK








We FADE UP FROM BLACK to see:
The soles of Django's bare feet. A rope is tied around the ankles, and
it's obvious he's been strung up, upside down.
The CAMERA moves down his naked body, down his legs (we see his wrists
are'bound with ropes to his thigh), down his bare buttocks, down his
whip scarred back, to the back of his head which hovers just about
three inches from the barn yard wooden floor.

INT - BARN - AFTERNOON
Eight year old stable boy, Timmy, wipes the unconscious Django's face
with a wet rag. They are all alone in the barn.
Django begins to come to ...

TIMMY

(SHHH'S HIM)
Act like you still sleepin'.

DJANGO
Where's Broomhilda?

TIMMY
Who?

DJANGO
Hildi, the slave girl that ran away a
couple of days ago. They had her in The
Hot Box.

TIMMY
I don't know 'bout no girl.

DJANGO
How 'bout that German white man I came
here with?

TIMMY
Oh he's dead. His body's over there.
Django twists upside down on the rope, and sees the corpse of his
friend King Schultz dead on the filthy barn yard floor. The sight of
the lifeless carcass of the doctor fills Django with pain and anger.
Just then head overseer Ace Woody walks in the barn.
Upon seeing Ace, Timmy hightails it out of there, Ace throws an empty
bucket at the fleeing boy.

ACE WOODY
Git on outta here, boy!









133
Django, slightly..swaying to and fro from the rope, looks upside down
at Ace Woody, all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie, which
makes him look a bit like Wyatt Earp.

ACE WOODY
So y'all bounty hunters,.huh?
Django thinks, "How does he know?"

ACE WOODY
I knew there was something fishy 'bout, y'all.
We found your wanted posters and book of figures
in your saddle bags. I gotta say, ain't never
heard of no black bounty hunter before. A black
boy paid to kill white men? How did ya like that
line of work?
Django retorts, upside down.

DJANGO
Well, it turns out I was a natural.
Ace woody laughs.

ACE WOODY
Boy, people 'round here are cross wit you.
Ace Woody pulls up a tiny milking stool, and sits down on it, a body
length from the hanging man.

ACE WOODY
See Boss Man was a rather beloved figure
'round here. Now he's dead as fried chicken,
everyone 'round here blames you.
Ace Woody opens his black suit jacket, we see not only does he wear a
gun and holster around his waist, he carries a HUGE BOWIE KNIFE ina
shoulder holster. He removes the big blade from its sheath.

ACE WOODY
Yep, Boss Man's gone. Poor Calvin. Poor
goddamn Calvin. We're burnin' him in a few
hours. At sunset. Should be real pretty.
However ... . I don't think you're gonna be
able to attend.
Ace takes the Bowie Knife and THROWS IT...
. IT LANDS stuck in the wooden barn yard floor, four inches from
Django's face.
Ace Woody slowly rises up from the tiny milking stool, and slowly walks
the length of the floor between him and Django, pulls the blade out of
the floor, and walks back to his stool, and sits back down.
As he does this, he says;









ACE WOODY
Now I understand you didn't really have
nuttin' to do wit it. It's that German
sunbitch the trouble maker. You just wanted
to git your girl, and hightail your nigger
asses outta here. Now I appreciate that.
But grieving folks 'round here need someone
to blame. And I guess they figure if you
hadn't brought your black ass 'round here
in the first place, Boss Man still be alive.
And you know what, they got a point.
He THROWS the knife again...
.this time IT LANDS in the floor two inches from Django's face.
He walks the same path from the knife and back to the tiny stool.
As he does he says;

ACE WOODY
Now when it comes to making a nigger regret
the error of his ways, believe me when I.
tell you, I know every goddamn trick in the
book. Now there's a lotta ass busters out
there try an' git creative with the way they
bust ass. But me... .I always found the best
methods are, tried and true.
He THROWS the knife again...
Django JERKS his head back ...
.and the knife LANDS in the floor, right where Django's head was.
Ace Woody stands up, walks the floor to the Bowie, yanks it out of the
wood., and straightens up, standing right beside the hanging upside down
naked black man. Ace talks confidentially to the bound man at his
mercy.

ACE WOODY
You know Blackie, here at Candyland, I had
me a real sweet deal. These last eleven years
training Calvin's mandingos I made me more
money I made my whole goddamn life.
And no end in sight, neither.

(BEAT)
Then you came along. Knocked me right off
that perch I was sittin' pretty on. You think
Miss Lara gonna be as.interested in
mandingos as her brother?
Uuummmm...I don't think so. What I think,
is you done fucked up my good thang.
So when it comes to you, Django boy, you
could say I gotta axe to grind.









IJS
He grabs a handfull of Django's genitals in his fist. He takes his big
Bowie, and places the razor sharp BLADE against Django's nut sack.
Django dances at the end of the rope like live bait on a fishing pole.

ACE WOODY
How's the blade of that Bowie feel against
your ball sack, Blackie? A Bowie right off
the wet stone. Now that's what I call sharp.
Django dances some more ...

ACE WOODY
Yep nigger, I'm gonna snip them nuts.

(BREATH)
On the count of three.

DJANGO SCREAMS:

DJANGO

NO!!!!

ACE WOODY

ONE ...

DJANGO

NO DON'T DO IT!!!!!

ACE WOODY
Got to do it, boy. TWO...

DJANGO

NO!!!! !
Just then Stephen appears in the entrance of the barn/blacksmith
facility. He's holding Django's clothes in a bundle under his arm.

STEPHEN
Cap't, Miss Lara lookin' for you. She wanna
talk about the Old Man's funeral.
Oh, and she changed her mind 'bout snippin'
Django. She gonna give 'em to the LeQuint
Dickey people.
While still keeping a firm grip on Django's'junk, Ace Woody says;

ACE WOODY
Well she didn't waste a minute tellin' me.
Ace Woody looks down at Django, both men get over the aborted emotion
of what almost happened.

ACE WOODY

(TO DJANGO)
How disappointing.









171

ACE WOODY

(TO STEPHEN)
Where she at?

STEPHEN
She in the big house. The kitchen.
Ace turns to leave, Stephen goes over to a big fiery furnace in the
blacksmith barn, and begins poking a LONG POKER which lies buried in
the fire.
Django's clothes are dumped by the furnace.

ACE WOODY
You gonna look after our friend?
As, he plays with the poker in the fire, he says;

STEPHEN
Oh yes sirree Bob, you know I am!
01' Snowball and a certain naked ass
upside down nigger we both know, gonna
have us a big of chat.
He removes the big black poker from the furnaces fire, it's RED HOT END

GLOWS ORANGE.

STEPHEN
Snowballs just makin' sure his talking
stick is all nice and FROSTY.
Ace Woody chuckles to himself as he exits the barn.
Just Stephen with a red hot poker, and naked, bound upside down Django,
alone.
With the red hot poker in his hand Snowball approaches the naked
hanging Django.

STEPHEN
I bet you an' that German thought y'all was
on easy street for awhile - didn't ya?
Y'all track Hildi to the Old Man.
You get the idea to go to Greenville -
look up the Ole Man there.

(BREATH)
That was a good idea. I bet y'all couldn't
believe how easy it was. You meet Moguy, he
buys your horseshit. Ya' git your ass invited
to Candyland, no fuss no muss. Ya' ride the
whole way to the plantation, no one the wiser.
Then ya' ride in to Candyland - ride your
goddamn horses right up to the motherfucking
Big House.









137

STEPHEN

(BEAT)
And that's where you met me. And that's when
you knew your goose was cooked.
He TOUCHES Django's NIPPLE with the ORANGE HOT TIP of the poker.
Unlike a lot of movie hero's, Django doesn't take torture silently and
stoically. This shit fucking hurts, so you best believe he screams his
fucking ass off, and twists in agony when he gets touched by the orange
tip of that red hot poker.

STEPHEN
Now that fancy talkin' white man of yours
didn't know what's what. He still thought his
ass hadda chance. But like the One-Eyed Charly
you are, you always know the end is near
'fore the white folks.
With the ORANGE HOT poker, he BURNS OFF Django's other NIPPLE.
The smell of burned flesh smokes in the air. Stephen makes a show of
breathing it in his nostrils.

STEPHEN
Damn Nigger, you smell good.
He walks behind Django with the poker.

STEPHEN
You know, when you was sittin' on that feather
bed in the quest room in the Big House -
After you slapped my ass to the floor
You were sayin' something 'bout my BARE BLACK
ass, and how you were gonna BUST IT.
Remember that, Bright Boy?
He places the HOT ORANGE END OF THE POKER hard against Django's BARE
buttocks.
Django SCREAMS!
Stephen LAUGHS.
Stephen walks away and sticks the poker back in the fire. He goes
through Django's clothes and pulls out his tan pants. He tosses them on
the floor by the hanging man.

STEPHEN
You leavin', that's what you can take
with you.
Stephen walks over to the hanging upside down man, and as he talks to
him, he begins fondling Django's genitals.









I31

STEPHEN
Now you were quite the topic of conversation
for the last few hours. Seemed like folks
never had a bright idea in their life, was
comin' up with different ways to kill your
ASS. Now most of 'dem ideas involved fuckin
wit your fun parts. But while that might SEEM
like a good idea. Truth is, once ya snip a
niggers nuts, most bleed out. Then I say;
"Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint
Dickey, got it worse then that." Then they're,
"Let's whip 'em to death," "Throw 'em to the
mandingos," "Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs."
And then I say, "What's so special 'bout that?
We do that shit all the time. Hells bells,
the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey got it
worse then that."
He stops massaging Django's balls.

STEPHEN
So Miss Lara got the bright idea of givin'
your ass to The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
And as a slave of The LeQuint Dickey Mining
Company, hence forth, till the day you die,
you will be swinging a sledgehammer, all day,
every day, turning big rocks into little rocks.
And trust me when I tell you it's gonna be
'bout as much fun as it sounds. We sell 'em
the mandingos ain't good for nuttin' no more.
Like them three y'all came back with. For them
big garboons we get twenty a piece. They last
'bout six months. Skinny nigger like you,
I give two or three.
Stephen turns to leave.

DJANGO
Where's Broomhilda?

STEPHEN
She's all right for now. Miss Lara
soft hearted on 'er. She gave her
to Billy Crash. He was sweet on 'er.
Now Billy Crash might not look or
smell too good, but ain't nobody
gonna bother her.
Stephen limps away.

CUT TO









137

EXT - CANDYLAND - AFTERNOON
The Caravan coming from The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company comes riding
up to the plantation. It comes equipped with one CAGE WAGON (from a
prison), ONE white trash PECKAWOOD named FLOYD to drive the wagon, a
2nd white trash PECKAWOOD named ROY to ride lead horse, and a white
trash PECKAWOOD named JANO to bring up the rear riding horses ass, plus
a pack horse that carries dynamite for the mine.
The three peckawoods, who all talk with thick Australian accents, have
stopped the caravan and are having a powwow.

ROY
It's chaos 'round here. Some bastard shot
the big boss. Let's git the niggers and
git out.
The Three mandingos who weren't sold in Greenville, Rodney, Chicken
Charly, and Chester are walked to the wagon by overseers Tommy Giles.
and Broomhilda's new owner Billy Crash. All three slaves carry the
bundles of personal belongings they've had since Greenville. Chester
wears a hat, and Chicken Charly has a corncob pipe in his mouth.
The wagon driver, Floyd, approaches them.

FLOYD
You blacks line up.
They do.

FLOYD
What's your names?

CHESTER
Chester.

CHICKEN CHARLY
Chicken Charly.

RODNEY
Rodney.

FLOYD
I'm.Floyd, this is Roy, and that's Jano.

(POINTING AT

CHESTER'S BUNDLE)
What's that?

CHESTER
It's my stuff.

FLOYD
Throw it in the dirt.









1 40
All three throw their only belongings in the dirt. Floyd takes the'hat
off of Chester's head and sails it away. As well as ripping the
corncob pipe out of Chicken Charly's mouth and tossing it in the dirt.

FLOYD
(to Chicken Charly)
You won't be doin' much smokin' mate.
(to all three)
You are now the property of The LeQuint
Dickey Mining Company. Git in the cage.
This is going to be worse then the three even thought. They climb into
the cage wagon. Floyd locks it behind them.
Roy, the head Aussie, pays Billy Crash for the slaves, when we hear Ace
Woody call out;

ACE WOODY (OS)
Hold on, we got another hammer swinger
for ya.
Ace Woody comes walking out of the barn with Django, shirtless and
barefoot (just like we met him at beginning of the story), wearing his
old tan pants, and his wrists bound by a rope.

ROY
We can't use that skinny bastard.

ACE WOODY
We got an arraignment with Mr.Dickey to take
punishment niggers from time to time.

ROY
No one tole' me 'bout no arraignment.

ACE WOODY
Well if Mr.Dickey ain't takin' you into his
confidence, I'm sure I don't know why.

ROY
Look, no one tole' me 'bout -

ACE WOODY
- No, you look peckawood, this nigger got Boss
Candie killed. And we want his ass punished.
Now I know you need our bucks. So.unless you
wanna ride back to the mine, and tell Mr.Dickey
how and why you fucked up our nice little
business relationship, take this nigger and
hush up about it!

ROY
Fine, stick 'em in the goddamn cage.









"H
Django sees the three mandingos in the cage. They see him too.
Django stops Ace Woody.

DJANGO
Whoa whoa whoa, you can't put me in there
with them. They'll kill me. What about all
that -turning big rocks into little rocks-
shit y'all was. talkin' about? I mean that was
the idea ain't it? You put me in there with
them big ass garboons they kill me on the way.
I mean if that's the idea, that's the idea,
but I didn't think that was the idea.
Ace knows he's right, so he turns to Roy and Floyd.

ACE WOODY
He can't go in there with them.

FLOYD
Why not?

ACE WOODY
They'll kill him.

FLOYD
I don't give a damn.

ACE WOODY
Well we do! He killed the fuckin Boss Man,
we want the mine to grind him to gravel!

ROY
Jano, you're riclin' horses ass, you take this
black and make sure he keeps up.

JANO
Oh, I'll keep 'em up.
Jano takes the rope tired around Django's wrists.and ties the other end
around his saddle horn.
The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company caravan leaves Candyland.

EXT - MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
The Caravan makes its way down a dirt road in pretty Chickasaw County.
Stoic Roy riding lead horse, Floyd driving the cage wagon, Rodney,
Chester, and Chicken Charly bouncing around inside the cage wagon, Jano
riding horses ass, and Django being led on foot behind him.









J42

DJANGO

(TO JANO)
Hey boy!
Jano ignores him.

DJANGO
I said, hey white boy!

JANO
Keep your mouth shut black, you ain't got
nothing to say I wanna hear.

DJANGO
What's he pay you?

JANO
Who?

DJANGO
LeQuint Dickey?

JANO
You gotta few more things to worry about
black boy, then what I get paid.

DJANGO
I ain't worried about it. I'm just curious.
I mean, I'm the property of The LeQuint Dickey
Mining Company, ain't I?

JANO
Yeah.

DJANGO
And you work for The LeQuint Dickey Mining
Company, dont'cha?

JANO
Yeah?

DJANGO
Well, I know how much I'm gettin' paid,
how much you gettin' paid? I mean like
for instance, how much you gettin' paid
for today?

JANO
Look black, it don't work like that. Dickey
paid for our passage from Australia to here.
We get a little money to send back home, and
pay him back for the boat trip.









I"

DJANGO
How long you been here?

JANO
'bout two years.

DJANGO
And you ain't paid him back yet?

JANO

(DEFENSIVELY)
No, not yet!

DJANGO

(LAUGHS)
You a slave too, peckawood. They just bought
your ass for the price of a boat ride.
At least they didn't charge us for our boat
ride ... . ha ha ha ha...

JANO

(YELLING)
You shut up!
Jano's hand grabs his riding crop, and he brings it up to strike
Django, when the black man says to him;

DJANGO
How'd you like to make eleven thousand
dollars?

JANO
What?
Django steps closer to him.

DJANGO
How would you like to make eleven thousand
dollars -- eleven thousand five hundred,
actually?
Roy, in the lead, yells back to Jano;

ROY
Goddamit Jano, stop fuckin with that black,
and keep up!

DJANGO
Keep riding, just ride slower.
They move forward, with Django walking beside Jano on his horse.









R44

DJANGO
Back at that plantation Candyland, there
was an eleven thousand five hundred dollar
fortune just sittin there, and y'all rode
right past it.

JANO
You be damned, blackie. We're not bandits.

DJANGO
That's what's nice about this fortune, it's
not illegal. You can't steal it, ya gotta
earn it.

JANO
If you got something to say, say it.

DJANGO
The eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune
waiting for you back at Candyland, is in the
form of a wanted dead or alive bounty on
Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang.

JANO
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

DJANGO
Smitty Bacall is the leader of a murdering
gang of stagecoach robbers, The Bacall Gang.
There's a seven thousand dollar dead or alive
bounty on him. And one thousand five hundred
dollars for each of his three accomplices,
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and Crazy Craig Koons.
And all four of them gentlemen are sittin back
there at Candyland...laughin their ass off...
cause they just got away with murder.

(BEAT)
But it don't hafta be that way. You and your
mates could get that money.

JANO
Who pays the money?

DJANGO
The Court.

JANO
The Court?

DJANGO
The Austin Texas Courthouse. Oh, and by
the way, the court don't give a damn about
how you kill 'em. You can shoot 'em in the
back, from up on a hill, in the back of
the head, in their sleep - don't matter.

(CON'T)









DJANGO

(CON'T)
Court doesn't care how you do it, just as
long as you do it.

JANO
They.pay us to kill 'em?

DJANGO
No. You kill 'em, and they payyou for the
corpse. Get it?

JANO
I think so... . what did these jokers do again?

DJANGO
Killed innocent people in a stagecoach
robbery. I've got the handbill in my pocket.
Django digs into his tan pants and pulls out the folded up Smitty
Bacall handbill that Dr.Schultz told him to hang on to for good luck.
He hands it to Jano.

JANO
What's this?

DJANGO
I told you, it's the handbill for Smitty
Bacall and The Bacall Gang.
Jano looks at the handbill.

DJANGO
Whatsamatter, can't you read?

JANO
I can read, I just don't have my glasses.
I didn't take 'em with me, because I didn't
think I'd be doin much readin' on a nigger run.

DJANGO
What about that cowboy fella in the lead?

JANO
Roy?

DJANGO
Can Roy read?

JANO
Look, get it straight black, I can fuckin
read. I just don't got my glasses.

EXT -- BEAUTIFUL MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY TABLEAUX at DUSK
The LeQuint Dickey Mining Co. Caravan has stopped, and pulled over to
the side of the road.

IN THE CAGE
Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester sit in the cage, and watch through
the bars this new turn of events without any.clear comprehension of
what they're watching.
What the three caged men are watching is the three Australian mining
company employees and Django, off in the distance (where they can't
hear what they're saying), having some sort of a discussion. That
includes the still bound by the wrists Django showing the three men a
piece of paper.

INSERT: SMITTY BACALL'S WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE HANDBILL
Roy holds it in his hand as he reads and Django talks.

DJANGO
I ain't no goddamn slave. Do I sound-like
a fuckin slave? I'm a bounty hunter.
Yesterday as a free man, I rode into
Candyland on a horse with my white German
partner, Dr.King Schultz. We'd tracked The
Bacall Gang from Texas all the way to
Chickasaw County. Found them laying low at
Candyland. We went in to get 'em, things
went sour. My partner was killed, and Calvin
Candie was shot. Everybody there decided to
blame me, so here I am.

(TO ROY)
You know I'm not on the manifest? All of you
know I'm not suppose to be on this trip.
But those four men, are still back there.
They're still wanted. And that eleven thousand
five hundred is still up for grabs. And the
last thing they'd expect is y'all rid.in back
and gittin it.
Django is damn convincing.

ROY
What's your deal? You tell us who they are
and we let ya go?

DJANGO
I ain't tellin' who they are. But, you give
me a pistol, and a horse, and five hundred
dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred,
and I'll point 'em out to you.
He's got these greedy sonsabitches right on the hook...he just needs
one little push.









1Q7

DJANGO
Y'all wanna ask somebody if I'm tellin the
truth, ask them mandingos. You can't put
me in the same cage with them without them
killin me. Why ya think that is? Ask them
.am I a Candyland slave, or did I ride in
there on a horse, with a white man, yesterday?

CUT TO

ROY AND FLOYD
go to the Cage Wagon to talk with the three mandingos. As they walk,
Roy continues to study the handbill.

ROY

(READING ALOUD)
"Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
The Bacall Gang. For murder and stagecoach
robbery. Seven thousand dollars for Bacall.
One thousand five hundred dollars for each
of his gang members... ." This is a real handbill.

FLOYD
Just because the handbill's real doesn't
mean that other bunch of malarky.is.

ROY
Why would a nigger slave have a wanted dead
or alive handbill in his pocket?
Floyd doesn't have an answer for that one.

ROY
That black's damn convincing.
They get to The Cage O'Men. Roy startles them with a direct question;

ROY
(pointing, behind
him, at Django)
That black ride into Candyland yesterday?
The Caged Men don't know what they're suppose to say.
Roy removes the pistol from his belt, cocks back the hammer and points
the barrel at the cage.

ROY
I'm gonna ask again, and remember I don't
like liars. Is he a Candyland slave, or did
he ride in with a white man yesterday?









CHESTER
Yeah. They walked us from the Greenville
Auction and he rode on a horse with a
white man.

ROY
This white man, was the black his slave?

RODNEY
He weren't no slave.

FLOYD
You sure about that?

RODNEY
Damn sure.
Roy starts taking the possibility of an eleven thousand dollar windfall
seriously.

ROY
What happened at Candyland?

CHICKEN CHARLY
Bunch of shootin, master got shot.

ROY
Who shot 'em?

CHICKEN CHARLY
The German.

ROY
And why did he do that?

CHICKEN CHARLY
The nigger and the German were actin as if they
were slavers, but they weren't.

ROY
What were they?

RODNEY
Bounty hunters.
Floyd is starting to get convinced.

FLOYD
Goddamn Roy, this could be big.
(to the Slaves)
Do you know who Smitty Bacall is?









!Y,

ROY
(barking at Floyd)
They wouldn't go by their outlaw names
you idiot!

CUT TO
Roy and Floyd walk back to Django and Jano.

ROY
Okay black, you gotta deal.
Jano reacts.

DJANGO
I got one more condition.

ROY
What?

DJANGO
When we get there, when the time comes,
you let me help you kill 'em.
Roy whips out a big knife, and cuts the rope around Django's wrists.

ROY

(LAUGHING)
You got a deal, black.
Django interrupts -

DJANGO
You gotta deal, mate.
Roy really laughs this time. As does Django and the other two Aussies.

ROY
You're all right for a black fella!

THE CAGE
Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester watch the sight of the white men
cutting the ropes that bound the black man's wrists, as well as them
all sharing a laugh, with wonderment. "Who is this Nigger?"

BACK WITH THE LAUGHING QUARTET

ROY
We'll give you that pack horse.

DJANGO
What's them saddle bags filled with?

FLOYD
Dynamite.








!so

DJANGO
I.ain't ridin no horse with no goddamn
dynamite on his back!

ROY

(CHUCKLE CHUCKLE)
Yeah, I can see why. Jano take those sticks
off that horse, and stick 'em in the nigger
cage.
Jano does this, lifting two out of four bags filled with dynamite off
the pack horse, and walking to the cage wagon, unlocking ' the cage door,
and placing the bags inside. The Black Men in the cage don't like this
at all.
Jano removes the last of the dynamite filled saddle bags from Django's
horse, throws them over his shoulders, and begins walking back to The
Cage Wagon.
Django moves to his new pack horse, and says;

DJANGO
Where's my pistol?

ROY
Floyd, you got that rifle on the wagon, give
'em your gun and your belt.
Floyd unbuckles his gun belt, gun and all, folds it up, and walks over
to Django handing it to him. Django accepts it.
About the pistol, Floyd tells Django;

FLOYD
Now don't drop it now. I just had the sights
fixed last month, it's perfect.
Django holding the gunbelt in his hand.

DJANGO
That's good to know.
Without taking the pistol out of the gunbelt, DJANGO SHOOTS FLOYD TWICE
in the chest...
Roy turns around...
Django takes the gun out of the holster...
. BAM...ROY is HIT in the UPPER BRAIN AREA and falls to the grass
dead.
Jano goes for the gun on his hip.
Django SHOOTS ONE OF THE SADDLE BAGS over.Jano's shoulder...KAHBOOM!!!!!








Jano is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS...
The KAHBOOM knocks Django on his ass...
The CAGE WAGON
Rodney, Chester, and Chicken Charlie come down from the shock of the
blast. The image outside the bars of their cage is of DUST and SMOKE in
the air, obscuring all visibility...

THEN ...
A sudden GUST OF WIND comes and BLOWS all the smoke and dust away,
REVEALING in bright color focus...
.DJANGO standing among the two dead Aussies, and whatever is left of
Jano.
He's shoeless and shirtless, but Floyd's pistol and gunbelt sit
wrapped around his waist.
He locks eyes with the three men in the cage..
He then moves towards the wagon, and unhooks the mine company beast,
and climbs aboard him bareback.
He leans over and snatches the RIFLE that Floyd kept on the wagon seat
next to him.
Grabbing a fistful of the horses mane, he digs his heels into the
beast's side. The pack animals SPRINGS TO LIFE under the new rider. By
now it should be apparent that Django brings the best out of horses, and
horses bring the best out of Django.
From his high horse Django looks down at The Three Caged Men...

.THEN...
Using the rifle in a QUICK ONE HANDED MOVE he SHOOTS the lock on the
cage door.
He looks at the three men, especially Rodney, then says;

DJANGO
Throw up that dynamite.
Rodney grabs a saddle bag full of dynamite and tosses it to Django on
his Horse.
Django wraps it around the Horse's neck, turns the beast around, and
without saying another word, rides back in the direction of Candyland.
The Three NOW FREE Mandingos, watch him ride away.
"Who was that nigger?"

A GORGEOUS BIG SKY SOUTHERN PURPLE AND ORANGE SUNSET WE PAN DOWN from
the sky and see in small black silhouette the Funeral Procession of
Calvin Candie carrying the Coffin of the former Master up the hill on
'Candyland that leads to the Graveyard.
A WHITE PREACHER walks out in front of the Procession.
Then comes Calvin Candie's Coffin carried by eight pallbearers,
Stephen, Moguy, Bartholomew, Ace Woody, Brown, Cody, and his best
mandingos SAMSON and GOLDIE.
The first mourner in line is Lara Lee dressed in a fancy black dress,
wide brim black hat, black veil, and ever present black Mammy (Cora)
crying at her side.

CORA
The sky's real pretty Miss Lara. Monsieur
Candie think it real nice.

LARA LEE
Ah, bless you sweet innocent Cora.

WE CROSS CUT WITH SHOTS
of Django RIDING THE HORSE on the way back to Candyland. The bare
backed black man riding the horse bareback, holding the RIFLE in one
hand, a fistful of the horses mane in the other, hauling ass against a
gorgeous SUNSET SKY, looks like an Indian.

EXT - TRACKER SHACK/BUNKHOUSE - SUNSET
The same GORGEOUS SUNSET SKY over the same shitty Tracker shack
-Bunkhouse that Mr.Stonesipher and his three obscure companions share.
The GERMAN SHEPHERDS (including Marsha) rest in the chicken wire kennel
next to the bunkhouse.

INT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET
The FOUR TRACKERS are.missing the funeral, hanging out in the bunkhouse
wearing their beards. Mr.Stonesipher, Lex, and Stew are playing a
mountain card game which looks like poker, except the way you get rid of
your cards is different. Instead of chips they play with, "NIGGER EARS"
(yes, the ears of slaves). On a second viewing the audience may notice
that some of the slaves at Candyland are missing one ear.
Jake, the biggest, is off by himself, pounding nails into a small
delicate BIRDHOUSE he's making.

EXT - WOODS-OUTSIDE THE SHACK - SUNSET
INSERT: HORSE HOOFS walking then stopping. Django's bare feet jump on
to the ground.

INT - DOG KENNEL - SUNSET
The FOUR DOGS lay out... . when, Marsha hears something, and raises her
head...

SHIRTLESS DJANGO
moves quietly through the woods.

MARSHA
rises to all fours, to listen and smell. out in the darkness, her three
PALS continue to lay out.

DJANGO BY A TREE
he can see the bunkhouse entrance, the LONG HANDLE AXE buried in the
chopping block, the kennel, and the one dog looking his way.

MARSHA

BARK!
The Other Three Dogs wake up, and go on alert.
Django disappears.

INT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET
They hear the barking inside.
Mr.STONESIPHER
Jake!
Jake building his birdhouse.

JAKE
Yeah?
Mr.STONESIPHER
Check on Marsha.
Jake, the one not playing the game, puts aside his hammer, and rises to
check on them (these guys are very sensitive about their dogs).

EXT - TRACKER SHACK
As the BARKING gets louder, WE SEE A CLOSE UP of The Axe in the
chopping block, and Django's hand REMOVING IT.

JAKE
opens the bunkhouse door-he sees directly a hundred feet in front of
him, Django standing there with the axe. Just as he reacts...

DJANGO ... . THROWS THE AXE...

JAKE ... . IT HITS HIM IN THE FACE.








After letting go of the axe handle, Django RUNS FULL SPEED toward Jake.
Before the other three have really registered what's happening, Django
has crossed the distance, and is YANKING The Axe out of JAKE'S FACE.
And with AXE in hand, Django chases and fights with all three trackers,
till after a point where he's CHOPPED DOWN TWO OF THEM, Lex, and Stew,
and now there's only Mr.Stonesipher left.
But Mr.Stonesipher has managed to draw his gigantic BUCK KNIFE, and is
able to fight back against Django. You know Stonesipher's great with a
knife, plus his fighting style is like one of his dogs, attack attack
attack.
Django uses the axe handle in a defensive position.
The expert Mountain Boy begins SCORING BLADE CUTS on shirtless Django.
The two men fight until they end up losing their weapons. Then it's
just a fight of brute strength, and survival. Mr.Stonesipher is
physically bigger then Django. But if Django's going to save Broomhilda,
not to mention get revenge on all these Candyland motherfuckers, he has
to take Stonesipher's ass out.
This Black Man who has been under the yoke of white man's domination
all his life, and this White Man who feeds black people to dogs, fight
each other for their life.
Django gets his arm around Stonesipher's neck in a headlock, but the
mountain boy is big enough to lift Django. So like a rodeo rider
holding onto bull for dear life, Django tightens his lock around his
opponents neck. Django gets his hand on the HAMMER Jake was building
the birdhouse with, and BRINGS IT CRASHING DOWN ON THE TOP OF

STONESIPHER'S HEAD.
That weakens Stonesipher.
He HITS HIM AGAIN IN THE HEAD.
That drops Stonesipher to his knees.
He HITS HIM AGAIN WITH THE HAMMER ON THE HEAD.
That puts the mountain man down on his back.
He HITS HIM ONE MORE TIME WITH THE HAMMER TO keep him down for good.
The Trackers are all dead.
Only the dogs mad barking remains.
EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT
The Funeral for Calvin Candie is underway. The Preacher reads some
words over him.









EXT - TRACKER SHACK - NIGHT
Django, half naked, splattered with blood from the axe murders, steps
out of the shack. He takes a wash basin off the window sill, and walks
over to the WATER PUMP.
Marsha and her three friends-continue to BARK like mad.
He PUMPS a couple of times, and water explodes into the bowl. He
begins washing the blood-off'of himself. As he washes, he says outloud;

DJANGO
What ya doin around here, boy?
Timmy steps from his watching place in the bushes.

TIMMY
I was just walkin' by.

DJANGO
Wanna help me out?

DJANGO
My woman, Hildi, is with Billy Crash.
You know where his shack is?

TIMMY

DJANGO
You show me?

TIMMY
Will I get in trouble?

DJANGO
Not by the time I get through killin'
everybody.
Timmy has never heard a black man talk like that. He believes him.

TIMMY
I'll show ya.

THEN ...
Django turns towards the barking dogs. He turns back to Timmy and asks;

DJANGO
You know what toadstools look like?









15-C

TIMMY
Sure do.

DJANGO

INSERT: TIMMY picking TOADSTOOLS (POISON MUSHROMS).
INSERT: DJANGO stirring a big pot of BEEF STEW with a wooden spoon in
the tracker shack.
Timmy comes'in carrying a bunch of toadstools inside his shirt.
Django takes the toadstools and Mr.Stonesipher's BUCK KNIFE and CHOPS
the mushrooms into tiny pieces.
He tosses the tiny bits of poisoned shrooms into the beefy sauce, and
mixes it up with the spoon.

EXT - MARSHA'S KENNEL - NIGHT
Django throws the pot of poisoned beef stew over the top of the kennel.
It lands on the ground with a PLOP.
The Angry Dogs, are nevertheless', still dogs, and greedily scarf up
the stew.
Django watches them wolf down their ultimate agony with a smile.

DJANGO
You bit your last nigger, bitch? Bite on that.
Django lifts Timmy up on to the bare backed wagon horse.

DJANGO
First things first, boy. Take me to my horse.

EXT - FUNERAL NIGHT
The funeral is in full melodramatic bore.

TNT - STABLE-BLACKSMITH - NIGHT
Timmy brings Django to the stable on the Candyland grounds. Django goes
straight up to the stall housing Tony and says hello. Tony's happy to
see him. Django feeds him an apple he picked along the way for him.
He turns and sees the body of Dr.Schultz lying in a heap.
And Schultz's horse Fritz in the stable.

DJANGO
Saddle up Fritz and Tony.








Timmy just stares.

DJANGO
Now, boy!
Timmy hops to work.
Django bends down over the body of Dr.Schultz, he takes Broomhilda's
bill of sale and freedom papers out of his back pocket. He also
searches for and finds Schultz's hidden DERRINGER, he keeps it in a
holster around his ankle.
As Timmy saddles the horses, he asks;

TIMMY
Do you feel bad for your friend?
Django rises from the body of his friend.

DJANGO
Yeah, "I do.
As Timmy saddles the horses he says;

TIMMY
I know just how ya feel. I lost a white
friend once. He drowned in the lake.
Django doesn't correct the difference between Dr.Schultz and a white
friend, because there's nothing he could say to Timmy to make him
understand.
He goes over to his pile of clothes, which still lie next to the
furnace. He Puts on his boots. His Green Jacket over his bare chest.
And finally his hat.
EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT
The service is over, everybody is hugging each other and holding hands,
and beginning to leave.

INT - BILLY CRASH'S SHACK - NIGHT
Billy Crash is in bed fucking Broomhilda. She doesn't wail, she doesn't
make any whimpering sounds, but her eyes constantly water.
As Billy's fucking her he says;

the 'ol man's gone.

BILLY CRASH
Now girl, I'm tryin' to be nice.

BROOMHILDA
I can't help it! I'm really sad!
He hops off her and yells at her.

BILLY CRASH
Well goddamit, you're a nigger! Life is sad
for niggers! Git use to it!

(CALMING DOWN)
Look you know Me, Hildi. I'm an ass buster
from way back. But you know I've always been
sweet on you. I don't wanna bust your ass.
So don't make me! Now I'm gonna go shit.
You calm down.
He exits the shack to go the outhouse, leaving Broomhilda alone.
WE MOVE INTO A CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA lying on the bed. She cries for
Django, she cries for herself...

.THEN...
She HEARS an IMPACT SOUND, and a MUFFLED "Ooomph" SOUND.
And through the spaces in the wooden planks that act as walls in Billy
Crash's shack, she sees a figure fall to the ground.
Then she sees another figure through the wooden planks move towards the
front door.

CU BROOMHILDA
Her face, stained with tears, watches the door.
A soft "Knock Knock" on the door.

BROOMHILDA

(SOFTLY)
Yes?
The VOICE on the other side of the door, says;

DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
Hey Little Trouble Maker.

She hops out of bed, and throws open the door...

THERE HE IS,
she runs into his arms.
EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT
The TWO OLD SLAVE.GRAVE DIGGERS are throwing the first shovelfuls of
dirt on Monsieur Calvin J. Candie's coffin.
The participants of this ritual, begin to move away from the grave. The
funeral is a private affair, just the Candie Family Unit, some of the
overseers, and the slaves. No one from town, except the Preacher.
The SLAVE MOURNERS begin. to move towards their living area, all saying
goodbye to Miss Lara. Miss Lara makes a big show of saying goodbye to
them.
A little cognizant of the Candie Family unit begin the walk off the

Here's your bill of sale, and freedom papers.
No matter what happens to me, hold on to these
and get out of the south.

BROOMHILDA
What's gonna happen to you?

DJANGO
Ain't nuttin' gonna happen to me honey,
I'm just sayin'. Now go to the stable, little
Timmy's got our horses .saddled. Your horse is
named Fritz. He's a damn fine horse. Meet me

BROOMHILDA
But what about you -

DJANGO

WOOD - STONE - PLASTER - DIRT - DUST - GLASS - SMOKE - GUNPOWDER
hang in the air.
The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
starts coming to their senses. Nobody was killed, or even seriously
hurt (unless you count eardrums), just stunned.
As their minds try and grasp with what just happened, their eyes look
up from the ground, and try and see through the smoke and dust.
The'SMOKE and DUST thins a little, and we see inside the smoke the
mansion has been obliterated, but The Big House front steps remain.
CUE cool MUSIC.
STEPHEN sees something in the smoke, squints.
ACE WOODY sees something in the smoke, squints.
BROWN and CODY see something in the smoke, squint.
In the SMOKE and DUST we begin to see a FIGURE, walking towards them.
ACE WOODY squints at the FIGURE.
MOGUY sees the.FIGURE.
CORA attending to Miss Lara sees the FIGURE, then MISS LARA sees it.
The FIGURE moves further out of the SMOKE and DUST.
ACE WOODY, on the ground, his hand starts to move towards the gun
around his waist.
Then he sees The FIGURE.is carrying something in his left hand...
.it's Floyd's Winchester, he raises it, and points it at Ace.
ACE WOODY's hand moves away from his gun.
The FIGURE steps out of the SMOKE. It's DJANGO dressed in his DJANGO

OUTFIT.
STEPHEN, ACE WOODY, MOGUY, LARA LEE, BARTHOLOMEW, CORA, BROWN and
JINGLE BELLS CODY, SAMPSON or GOLDIE...Nobody can believe Django's
standing there.
He stands at the top of the front steps of The Big House, looking down
at The Candie Family Unit, all lying on the front lawn, Winchester
rifle held casually in his left hand. His right hand held casually by
the gun on his hip.
The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
all on their ass in the grass, look up at Django with a mixture of
Wonder, Fear, and Hate.









ICZ

WE MOVE INTO A ROMANTIC CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA
as she watches this.
As DJANGO looks out at the ten stunned enemies spread out on The Big
House front lawn,. and as they look back from the grass at him.
The black man in the cool green jacket says;

DJANGO
I bet I.know what you're thinkin', Ace Woody?
You'.re thinkin', why didn't I'cut off that
niggers nuts when .1 had the'chance? Right?

ACE WOODY
I guess I shoulda'.

DJANGO
Yes you should of.
He points the Winchester at the people spread out on the grass.

DJANGO
Everybody stand up!
It's now Django who gives the orders. They stand up quickly.
Django, with the rifle pointing at them, just looks at The Candie
Family Unit. Enjoying their collective hatred.

THEN...
He tosses the rifle away.
Then moves his right hand by his gun belt in his holster, as he takes a

SHOWDOWN STANCE.
EVERYBODY realizes DJANGO's intentions.
Even BROOMHILDA and TIMMY.
DJANGO looks down from his position at the top of The Big House steps
at the ten people, and says;

DJANGO
All black folks, take ten steps away from
the white folks.
DJANGO's eyes go to STEPHEN, who looks back at him.

DJANGO
Not you Stephen. You're right where you
belong.









163
The Black Folks, Cora, Bartholomew, Samson, and Goldie begin taking ten
steps away from the White Folks and the gunfight.
LARA LEE can't believe Cora's leaving her.
CORA is "I'm sorry Miss Lara, but I never did nuttin' to that nigger."
DJANGO looks to STEPHEN, and takes Schultz's hidden Derringer out of
his pocket.

DJANGO

(TO STEPHEN)
Let's see if you can handle this as well
as you can my nuts?
He tosses the Ole Man the tiny gun.

DJANGO

(TO EVERYBODY)
Somebody give Miss Lara a gun.
BROWN gives LARA LEE one. of his two guns.

BROWN

(TO DJANGO)
Can I at least cock it for her?

DJANGO
Yep.
BROWN cocks back the hammer of the peacemaker, and puts it in her hand,
and points it towards the ground.

BROWN
(to Lara Lee)
Okay Miss Lara, keep it pointed down till
the shootin' starts. Then bring it up as
fast as you can.
LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLI can't come to grips with what she's.in the
middle of, who she's facing, what's in her hand, or what's about to
happen.

DJANGO
(to the six)
Make your play hillbillies.
The MUSIC SWELLS.









16'F
EVERYBODY, except for LARA LEE is READY:

DJANGO ACE WOODY

STEPHEN MOGUY

BROWN CODY

LARA LEE
The PEOPLE watching on the side:

BARTHOLOMEW SAMSON BROOMHILDA

CORA GOLDIE TIMMY
EVERYONE'S ready, but no one wants to start this party...

TILL...
ACE WOODY starts to go for the gun in his holster, and STEPHEN starts
to raise his Derringer.
But it's no contest.
As soon as Django saw any movement from the six in front of him,
Floyd's Pistol was QUICKSILVER FAST in. his right hand, as his left hand
FANNED the Pistols Hammer, SHOOTING INSTANTLY all five White People (and
Stephen) standing in front of him.
They all fall to grass in different ways..
It was never any contest, they and WE (the audience) just didn't know
HOW GOOD DJANGO was.

FLASH ON
DJANGO showing off his incredible FAST DRAW and ACCURATE MARKSMANSHIP
to Dr.Schultz.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(SMILING)
You know what they're going to call you,
my boy? "The fastest gun in the South."

BACK TO SHOWDOWN
DJANGO stands on the top steps of what's left of'The Big House, looking
down at The Candie Family Unit, who all lay dead or dying on the
Candyland front lawn.
The WITNESSES can't fathom what they'just witnessed.









/65
All the CANDIE FAMILY UNIT lies on the grass SHOT. But some are still
alive. We HEAR MOANING coming from LARA LEE, CODY, and MOGUY.
DJANGO sees this.
The Black Man reaches behind him and comes out with a DYNAMITE STICK.
He tosses it on the grass among the bodies.
He takes aim with his pistol; and FIRES.
It EXPLODES.
Finishing off what was left of the Candie Family Unit, not to mention,
blowing the limbs off of many of them.
The LAWN is SILENT.
DJANGO'S PISTOL goes back in its holster.
Django walks down the front steps of The Big House, feeling tremendous
satisfaction in the wrath he just wroth on Candie and Co.
He removes Dr.Schultz's tiny Derringer from Stephen's dead hand,
putting it in his pocket. Then heads over to where Broomhilda and Timmy
wait for him with Fritz and Tony.
As he,walks up to Broomhilda on Fritz, he says;

DJANGO
Hey Little Trouble Maker.

BROOMHILDA
Hey Big Trouble Maker.

DJANGO
Down, boy.
Timmy hops off of Tony.
Django climbs aboard Tony. He says to Broomhilda;

DJANGO
I tole' you ain't nuttin' gonna happen
to me.

BROOMHILDA
Yes you did.

DJANGO
Girl, you're gonna hafta start trustin' me.

BROOMHILDA
I'll keep that in mind.









Â–º66
Django looks down to Timmy.

DJANGO
Thanks for the help, boy.
He reaches into his saddle bag, and pulls out an apple, and tosses it
down to Timmy.

DJANGO
That's for you. Good luck Tim.
(he points to
the Northern Sky)
The North star, is that one.
He looks to Broomhilda on Fritz.

DJANGO
You gonna hafta keep up, ya know?

BROOMHILDA
You won't wait for me.

DJANGO
Better not.

BROOMHILDA
You won't.

DJANGO

(SMILING)
Better not.

BROOMHILDA

(SMILING)
You won't.
They kiss.
Then, astride Tony, Django leaves Candyland having rescued his
Broomhilda from her Mountain, her Ring of Hellfire, and all her
Dragons.EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY

The modest dairy farm in the countryside of Nancy, France (what the French call cow country).

We read a SUBTITLE in the sky above the farmhouse:

CHAPTER ONE:

“ONCE UPON A TIME IN . . .

NAZI-OCCUPIED FRANCE”

This SUBTITLE disappears and is replaced by another one:

“1941

One year into the German

occupation of France”

The farm consists of a house, a small barn, and twelve cows spread about.

The owner of the property, a bull of a man, FRENCH FARMER, brings an ax up and down on a tree stump, blemishing his property. However, simply by sight, you’d never know if he’s been beating at this stump for the last year or just started today.

JULIE:

one of his three pretty teenage daughters, is hanging laundry on the clothesline. As she hangs up a white bedsheet, she hears a noise. Moving the sheet aside, she sees:

JULIE’S POV

A Nazi town car convertible, with two little Nazi flags attached to the hood, a NAZI SOLDIER behind the wheel, a NAZI OFFICER alone in the backseat, following TWO OTHER NAZI SOLDIERS on motorcycles, coming up over the hill on the country road leading to their farm.

JULIE:

Pappa.

The French farmer sinks his ax in the stump, looks over his shoulder, and sees the Germans approaching.

The FARMER’S WIFE, CHARLOTTE, comes to the doorway of their home, followed by her TWO OTHER TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, and sees the Germans approaching.

The farmer yells to his family in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

FARMER:

Go back inside and shut the door.

FARMER:

(to Julie)

Julie, get me some water from the pump to wash up with, then get inside with your mother.

The young lady runs to the water pump by the house. She picks up a basin and begins pumping. After a few pumps, water comes out, splashing into the basin.

The French farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping away at, pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from his face, and waits for the Nazi convoy to arrive. After living for a year with the sword of Damocles suspended over his head, this may very well be the end.

Julie finishes filling the water basin and places it on the windowsill.

JULIE:

Ready, Pappa.

FARMER:

Thank you, darling, now go inside and take care of your mother. Don’t run.

Julie walks inside the farmhouse and closes the door behind her.

As her father stands up from the stump and moves over to the windowsill with the water basin . . .

. . . The SOUND OF THE ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get

LOUDER.

The farmer SPLASHES water from the basin on his face and down his front. He takes a towel off a nail and wipes the excess water from his face and chest, as he watches the two motorcycles, the one automobile, and the four representatives of the National Socialist Party come to a halt on his property.

We don’t move into them but keep observing them from a distance, like the farmer.

The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLISTS are off their bikes and standing at attention next to them.

The NAZI DRIVER has walked around the automobile and opened the door for his superior.

The NAZI OFFICER says to the driver in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN:

NAZI OFFICER:

This is the property of Perrier LaPadite?

NAZI DRIVER:

Yes, Herr Colonel.

The Nazi officer climbs out of the backseat of the vehicle, carrying in his left hand a black leather attaché case.

NAZI OFFICER:

Herrman, until I summon you, I am to be left alone.

NAZI DRIVER:

As you wish, Herr Colonel.

The S.S. colonel yells to the farmer in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

NAZI OFFICER:

Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?

FARMER:

I am Perrier LaPadite.

The S.S. colonel crosses the distance between them with long strides and says, in French, with a smile on his face:

NAZI OFFICER:

It is a pleasure to meet you, Monsieur LaPadite. I am Colonel Hans Landa of the S.S.

COL. HANS LANDA offers the French farmer, PERRIER LAPADITE, his hand. The Frenchman takes the German hand in his and shakes it.

PERRIER:

How may I help you?

COL. LANDA

I was hoping you could invite me inside your home and we may have a discussion.

INT—LAPADITE FARMHOUSE—DAY

The door to the farmhouse swings open, and the farmer gestures for the S.S. colonel to enter. Removing his gray S.S. cap, the German steps inside the Frenchman’s home.

Col. Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the farmer’s wife and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen, smiling in his direction.

The farmer enters behind him, closing the door.

PERRIER:

Colonel Landa, this is my family.

The S.S. colonel clicks his heels together and takes the hand of the French farmer’s wife . . .

COL. LANDA

Col. Hans Landa of the S.S., Madame, at your service.

He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his hostess’s hand . . .

COL. LANDA

Please excuse my rude intrusion on your routine.

FARMER’S WIFE

Don’t be ridiculous, Herr Colonel.

While still holding the French woman’s hand and looking into her eyes, the S.S. colonel says:

COL. LANDA

Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have heard in the village about your family are all true. Your wife is a beautiful woman.

His eyes leave the mother and move to the three daughters.

COL. LANDA

(CON’T)

And each of your daughters is more lovely than the last.

PERRIER:

Merci. Please have a seat.

The farmer offers the S.S. colonel a seat at the family’s wooden dinner table. The Nazi officer accepts the French farmer’s offer and lowers himself into the chair, placing his gray S.S. cap on the table and keeping his black attaché case on the floor by his feet.

The farmer (perfect host) turns to his wife and says:

PERRIER:

Charlotte, would you be so good as to get the

Colonel some wine?

COL. LANDA

Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine. This being a dairy farm, one would be safe in assuming you have milk?

CHARLOTTE:

Oui.

COL. LANDA

Then milk is what I prefer.

CHARLOTTE:

Very well.

The mother of three takes a carafe of milk out of the icebox

and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for the colonel.

The S.S. colonel takes a long drink from the glass, then puts it down LOUDLY on the wooden table.

COL. LANDA

Monsieur, to both your family and your cows I say: Bravo.

PERRIER:

Merci.

COL. LANDA

Please, join me at your table.

PERRIER:

Very well.

The French farmer sits at his wooden dinner table across from the Nazi.

The women remain standing.

Col. Landa leans forward and says to the farmer in a low tone of confidentiality:

COL. LANDA

Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to discuss would be better discussed in private. You’ll notice, I left my men outdoors. If it wouldn’t offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside?

PERRIER:

You are right.

PERRIER:

(to his women)

Charlotte, would you take the girls outside. The Colonel and I need to have a few words.

The farmer’s wife follows her husband’s orders and gathers her daughters, taking them outside, closing the door behind them.

The two men are alone at the farmer’s dinner table, in the farmer’s humble home.

COL. LANDA

Monsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform you I’ve exhausted the extent of my French. To continue to speak it so inadequately would only serve to embarrass me. However, I’ve been led

to believe you speak English quite well?

PERRIER:

Oui.

COL. LANDA

Well, it just so happens, I do as well. This being your house, I ask your permission to switch to English for the remainder of the conversation.

PERRIER:

By all means.

They now speak ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA

Monsieur LaPadite, while I’m very familiar with you and your family,

I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am. Are you aware

of my existence?

The farmer answers:

PERRIER:

Yes.

COL. LANDA

This is good. Are you aware of the job I’ve been ordered to carry out in France?

PERRIER:

Yes.

The colonel drinks more milk.

COL. LANDA

Please tell me what you’ve heard?

PERRIER:

I’ve heard the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for gentile.

The S.S. colonel smiles.

COL. LANDA

The Führer couldn’t have said it better himself.

PERRIER:

But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.

The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.

COL. LANDA

I’m aware of that. I read the report on this area. But like any enterprise,

when under new management, there’s always a slight duplication of efforts. Most of it being a complete waste of time, but it needs to be done nevertheless.

I just have a few questions, Monsieur LaPadite. If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the

file on your family.

Taking his black leather attaché case and placing it on the table, he takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts an expensive black fountain pen from his uniform’s front pocket. Opening the folder and referring to it:

COL. LANDA

Now, before the occupation there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself:

the Loveitts, the Doleracs, the Rollins, and the Dreyfuses, is that correct?

PERRIER:

To my knowledge those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.

Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?

Looking up from his papers:

COL. LANDA

Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your house.

Make yourself comfortable.

The farmer gets up from the table, goes to a shelf over the fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the fixings to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi guest.

As the farmer loads the bowl of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S. colonel studies the papers in front of him.

COL. LANDA

Now, according to these papers, all

the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for—except the Dreyfuses. Somewhere in the last year it would appear they have vanished.

Which leads me to the conclusion that they’ve either made good their escape

or someone is very successful hiding them. (looking up from

his papers, across the table at the farmer)

What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, Monsieur LaPadite?

PERRIER:

Only rumors—

COL. LANDA

—I love rumors! Facts can be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing. So, Monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding

the Dreyfuses?

The farmer looks at Landa.

COL. LANDA

Speak freely, Monsieur LaPadite, I want to hear what the rumors are, not who told them to you.

The farmer puffs thoroughly on his pipe.

PERRIER:

Again, this is just a rumor—but we

heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.

COL. LANDA

So the rumors you’ve heard have been of escape?

PERRIER:

Yes.

COL. LANDA

Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfuses friendly?

As the farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind his chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the floorboards, revealing:

FIVE HUMAN BEINGS

lying horizontally underneath the farmer’s floorboards. These human beings are the DREYFUSES, who have lived lying down underneath the dairy farmer’s house for the past year. But one couldn’t call what the Dreyfuses have done for the last year living. This family has done the only thing they could—hide from an occupying army that wishes to exterminate them.

PERRIER:

We were families in the same community, in the same business. I wouldn’t say

we were friends, but members of the same community. We had common interests.

The S.S. colonel takes in this answer, seems to accept it, then moves to the next question.

COL. LANDA

Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?

PERRIER:

There were five of them.

The father, Jacob . . . wife, Miriam . . . her brother, Bob . . .

COL. LANDA

—How old is Bob?

PERRIER:

Thirty—thirty-one?

COL. LANDA

Continue.

PERRIER:

And the children . . . Amos . . . and Shosanna.

COL. LANDA

Ages of the children?

PERRIER:

Amos—six—I believe. And Shosanna

was fifteen or sixteen, I’m not really sure.

CUT TO:

EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY

The mother and her three daughters finish taking the laundry off the clothesline.

They can’t hear anything going on inside.

The three Nazi soldiers watch the three daughters.

BACK TO LANDA AND PERRIER

COL. LANDA

Well, I guess that should do it.

He begins gathering up his papers and putting them back into his attaché case.

The farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe.

COL. LANDA

However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?

PERRIER:

But of course.

The farmer stands up, goes over to the icebox, and takes out the carafe of milk. As he walks over and fills the Nazi colonel’s glass, the German officer talks.

COL. LANDA

Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?

PERRIER:

I have no interest in such things.

COL. LANDA

But you are aware of what they call me?

PERRIER:

I’m aware.

COL. LANDA

What are you aware of?

PERRIER:

That they call you “the Jew Hunter.”

COL. LANDA

Precisely! Now I understand your trepidation in repeating it.

Before he was assassinated, Heydrich

apparently hated the moniker the good people of Prague bestowed on him. Actually, why he would hate the name “the Hangman” is baffling to me. It would appear he did everything in

his power to earn it. But I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title, precisely because I’ve earned it.

As “the Jew Hunter” enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize with the French farmer.

COL. LANDA

The feature that makes me such an

effective

hunter

of the Jews is, as opposed

to most German

soldiers, I can

think like a Jew,

where they can

only think like

a German or, more

precisely, a

German

soldier.

Now if

one were

to determine what

attribute the

German

people share with a beast,

it would be the

cunning and predatory instinct of

a hawk.

COL. LANDA

(CON’T)

Negroes—gorillas—brain—lips—smell—physical strength—penis size.

But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would

be that of the rat.

Now the Führer and Goebbels’s propaganda have said pretty much the same thing. Where our conclusions differ is I don’t consider the comparison an insult. Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in. It’s a hostile world indeed. If a rat were to scamper through your front door right now, would you greet it with hostility?

PERRIER:

I suppose I would.

COL. LANDA

Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?

PERRIER:

Rats spread disease, they bite people—

COL. LANDA

Unless some fool is stupid enough to

try and handle a live one, rats don’t make it a practice of biting human beings. Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that was some time ago. In all your born days, has a rat ever caused you to be sick a day in your life? I propose to you, any disease a rat could spread a squirrel would equally carry.

Yet I assume you don’t share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?

PERRIER:

No.

COL. LANDA

Yet they are both rodents, are they

not? And except for the fact that one has a big bushy tail, while the other has a long repugnant tail of rodent skin, they even rather look alike, don’t they?

PERRIER:

It is an interesting thought,

Herr Colonel.

COL. LANDA

However, interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel. If a rat were to scamper through your door this very minute, would you offer it a saucer of your delicious milk?

PERRIER:

Probably not.

COL. LANDA

I didn’t think so. You don’t like them. You don’t really know why you don’t like them. All you know is, you find them repulsive.

(lets the

metaphor sink in)

What a tremendously hostile world a rat must endure. Yet not only does he survive, he thrives. And the reason for this is because our little foe has an instinct for survival and preservation second to none. And that, Monsieur, is what a Jew shares with a rat.

Consequently, a German soldier conducts

a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews. Where does the hawk look? He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic,

he looks in the cellar—he looks everywhere he would hide. But there are many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide. However, the reason the Führer brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.

Because I’m aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.

(changing tone)

May I smoke my pipe as well?

The farmer’s cool facade is little by little eroding.

PERRIER:

Please, colonel, make yourself at home.

The Jew Hunter removes both a pipe and a bag of tobacco fixings. The pipe, strangely enough, is a calabash, made from an S-shaped gourd with a yellow skin and made famous by Sherlock Holmes.

As the Nazi colonel busies himself with his smoking, he continues to hold court at the Frenchman’s table.

COL. LANDA

The other mistake the German soldiers make is their severe handling of the citizens who give shelter and aid to the Jews. These citizens are not enemies of the state. They are simply confused people, trying to make some sense out of the madness war creates.

These citizens do not need punishing. They simply need to be reminded of their duty in wartime.

Let’s use you as a example, Monsieur LaPadite. In this war, you have found yourself in the middle of a conflict that has nothing to do with yourself, your lovely ladies, or your cows—yet here you are.

So, Monsieur LaPadite, let me propose

a question. In this time of war, what is your number-one duty? Is it to fight

the Germans in the name of France to your last breath? Or is it to harass the occupying army to the best of your

ability? Or is it to protect the poor, unfortunate victims of warfare who can

not protect themselves?

Or is your number-one duty in this time of bloodshed to protect those very beautiful women who constitute your family?

The Colonel lets the last statement stand.

COL. LANDA

That was a question, Monsieur LaPadite. In this time of war, what do you consider your number- one duty?

PERRIER:

To protect my family.

COL. LANDA

Now, my job dictates that I must have

my men enter your home and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family’s name off my list.

COL. LANDA

(CON’T)

And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured, they will be.

That is, unless you have something to tell me that will make the conducting of a search unnecessary.

(pause)

I might add also that any information that makes the performing of my duty easier will not be met with punishment. Actually quite the contrary, it will be met with reward.

And that reward will be your family will cease to be harassed in any way

by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.

The farmer, pipe in mouth, stares across the table at his German opponent.

COL. LANDA

You are sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?

PERRIER:

Yes.

COL. LANDA

You’re sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren’t you?

PERRIER:

Yes.

COL. LANDA

Point out to me the areas where they’re hiding.

The farmer points out the areas on the floor where the Dreyfuses are underneath.

COL. LANDA

Since I haven’t heard any disturbance,

I assume that while they’re listening, they don’t speak English?

PERRIER:

Yes.

COL. LANDA

I’m going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade—is that clear?

PERRIER:

Yes.

Col. Landa stands up from the table and, switching to FRENCH, says,

SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA

Monsieur LaPadite, I thank you for your milk and your hospitality. I do believe our business here is done.

The Nazi officer opens the front door and silently motions for his men to approach the house.

COL. LANDA

Madame LaPadite, I thank you for your time. We shan’t be bothering your family any longer.

The soldiers enter the doorway. Col. Landa silently points out the area of the floor the Jews are hiding under.

COL. LANDA

So, Monsieur and Madame LaPadite,

I bid you adieu.

He motions to the soldiers with his index finger.

They TEAR UP the wooden floor with MACHINE-GUN FIRE.

The little farmhouse is filled with SMOKE, DUST, SPLINTERS, SCREAMS, BULLET CASINGS, and even a little BLOOD.

With a hand motion from the colonel, the soldiers cut off their gunfire. The colonel keeps his finger in the air to indicate silence.

UNDERNEATH THE FLOORBOARDS

The entire Dreyfus family lies dead. Except for sixteen-year-old SHOSANNA, who miraculously escaped being struck by the Nazis’ bullets. With her dead family surrounding her, the young girl goes for freedom (represented by a wire-mesh vent).

COL. LANDA

hears a movement underneath the floor, looks down, and sees a SHAPE moving forward between the planks in the floor.

COL. LANDA

It’s the girl. Nobody move!

VENT:

is KICKED open, the girl SPRINGS out.

COL. LANDA

as he crosses the floor, sees the young girl RUNNING toward the cover of the woods. He unlatches the window and opens it. Shosanna is perfectly FRAMED in the windowsill.

SHOSANNA:

RUNNING toward the woods. Farmhouse and Colonel in the window in B.G.

FILTHY BARE FEET

SLAPPING against wet grass.

of the fleeing Shosanna.

COL. LANDA

changes his mind. He yells to the rat fleeing the trap, heading for the safety of the woodpile, in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA

Au revoir, Shosanna!

SHOSANNA:

makes it to the woods and is gone.

The S.S. colonel closes the window.

EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY

The Nazi town car DRIVES away.

EXT—NAZI TOWN CAR (MOVING)—DAY

Col. Hans Landa sits in the backseat of the convertible that’s speeding away from the French farmhouse.

Landa speaks to his driver in GERMAN, SUBTITLE IN ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA

Herrman, I sense a question on your lips?

Out with it?

DRIVER:

Why did you allow an enemy of the state to escape?

COL. LANDA

Oh, I don’t think the state is in too much danger, do you?

DRIVER:

I suppose not.

COL. LANDA

I’m glad you see it my way. Besides,

not putting a bullet in the back of a fifteen- year-old girl and allowing

her to escape are not necessarily

the same thing. She’s a young girl, no food, no shelter, no shoes, who’s just witnessed the massacre of her entire family.

She may not survive the night. And after word spreads about what happened today, it’s highly unlikely she will find any willing farmers to extend her aid.

If I had to guess her fate, I’d say she’ll probably be turned in by some neighbor.

Or she’ll be spotted by some German soldier. Or we’ll find her body in the woods, dead from starvation or exposure. Or, perhaps . . . she’ll survive. She will elude capture. She will escape to America. She will move to New York City, where she will be elected President of

the United States.

The S.S. colonel chuckles at his little funny.

CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:

CHAPTER TWO:

“INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS”

FADE UP:

EXT—SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND—DAY

A bunch of SOLDIERS are lined up at attention.

LIEUTENANT ALDO RAINE, a hillbilly from the mountains of Tennessee, walks down the line. He recruits the men the

Germans will later call “The Basterds.” Lt. Aldo has one defining physical characteristic, a ROPE BURN around his neck—as if, once upon a time, he survived a LYNCHING.

The scar will never once be mentioned.

LT. ALDO

My name is Lt. Aldo Raine, and I’m puttin’ together a special team.

And I need me eight soldiers. Eight—Jewish—American—soldiers. Now y’all might of heard rumors about the armada happening soon. Well, we’ll be leavin’ a little earlier. We’re gonna be dropped into France, dressed as civilians. And once we’re in enemy territory, as

a bushwackin’, guerrilla army, we’re gonna be doin’ one thing, and one thing only—Killin’ Nazis.

The members of the National Socialist Party have conquered Europe through murder, torture, intimidation, and terror. And that’s exactly what we’re gonna do to them. Now I don’t know ’bout y’all? But I sure as hell didn’t come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross five thousand miles

of water, fight my way through half Sicily, and then jump out of a fuckin’ air-o-plane to teach the Nazis

lessons in humanity. Nazi ain’t got

no humanity. They’re the foot soldiers of a Jew-hatin’, mass-murderin’ maniac, and they need to be destroyed.

That’s why any and every son-of-a-bitch we find wearin’ a Nazi uniform, they’re gonna die.

LT. ALDO

(CON’T)

We will be cruel to the Germans, and through our cruelty, they will

know who we are. They will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered, and

disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us. And the Germans will not be able to help themselves from imagining the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and

our bootheels, and the edge of our knives.

And the Germans will be sickened by us. And the Germans will talk about us.

And the Germans will fear us.

And when the Germans close their eyes at night and their subconscious

tortures them for the evil they’ve done, it will be thoughts of us

that it tortures them with.

He stops pacing and looks at everybody.

LT. ALDO

Sound good?

They all say:

ALL:

Yes, sir!

LT. ALDO

That’s what I like to hear. But I

got a word of warning to all would-be warriors. When you join my command,

you take on debit. A debit you owe

me, personally. Every man under my command owes me one hundred Nazi scalps. And I want my scalps.

And all y’all will git me one hundred Nazi scalps, taken from the heads of one hundred dead Nazis . . .

or you will die trying.

“BAVARIA

BERCHTESGADEN:

(HITLER’S PRIVATE LAIR)”

INT—BERCHTESGADEN—DAY

In a huge room, ADOLF HITLER pounds on a big table with his fist as he rants at TWO GERMAN GENERALS.

They speak GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

HITLER:

How much more of these Jew swine must I endure? They butcher my men like they were fish bait! This pack of filthy degenerates are doing what

the Russian army didn’t and Patton’s army couldn’t—turning soldiers of

the Third Reich into superstitious old women!

GERMAN GENERAL:

Just the cowards among them, mein Führer.

Hitler pounds furiously on the desk with his fist.

HITLER:

No, no, no, no, no, no! I have heard

the rumors myself! Soldiers of the Third Reich, who have brought the world to their knees, now pecking and clucking like chickens. Do you know the latest rumor they’ve conjured up, in their fear-induced delirium? The one that beats

my boys with a bat. The one they call “the Bear Jew” . . . is a golem.

An avenging Jew angel, conjured up by a vengeful rabbi, to smite the Aryans!

GENERAL:

Mein Führer, this is just soldiers’ gossip. No one really believes the

Bear Jew is a golem.

HITLER:

Why not? They seem to be able to elude capture like an apparition.

They seem to be able to appear and disappear at will.

HITLER:

(CON’T)

You want to prove they’re flesh and blood? Then

BRING THEM TO ME!

I will hang them naked, by their heels, from the Eiffel Tower! And then throw their bodies in the sewers, for the rats of Paris to feast!

The Führer sits down at the table to compose himself and wipe his greasy black hair out of his face.

HITLER:

(disgusted)

The Bear Jew.

He hits the button on the intercom on his desk.

HITLER:

Kliest!

KLIEST’S VOICE comes out of the intercom:

KLIEST’S VOICE (OS)

Yes, mein Führer.

HITLER:

I have an order I want relayed to all German soldiers stationed in France.

The Jew degenerate known as the Bear Jew henceforth is never to be referred to as the Bear Jew again. We will cease to aid the Americans any longer in their attempt to

undermine the German soldier’s psyche. Did you get that, Kliest?

KLIEST’S VOICE (OS)

Yes, mein Führer. Do you still wish to see Private Butz?

HITLER:

Who and what is a private Butz?

KLEIST’S VOICE (OS)

He’s the soldier you wanted to see personally. His squad was ambushed

by Lt. Raine’s Jews. He was its only survivor.

HITLER:

Indeed I do want to see him. Thank you for reminding me. Send him in.

CUT TO:

EXT—FRENCH WOODS—DAY

CU FACE OF DEAD GERMAN SOLDIER

His head lies on the ground, horizontal. A HAND reaches into

the FRAME, KNOCKS aside the dead German patriot’s helmet, and grabs a handful of the cadaver’s blond hair. A LARGE KNIFE

ENTERS THE FRAME and begins SLICING ALONG THE HAIRLINE.

This process is called SCALPING.

After SLICING is complete, the SCALP easily peels off, like a banana skin.

GERMAN PRISONERS PVT. BUTZ AND SGT. RACHTMAN on their knees, hand behind their heads.

Pvt. Butz NARRATES the scene in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

PVT. BUTZ (VO)

Werner and I were the only ones left alive after the ambush. While one man guarded us, the rest removed the hair. All the Basterds wore German scalps

tied to their belts.

CU SCALPS:

hanging from belts.

PVT. BUTZ (VO)

They not only took valuables . . .

WE SEE QUICK CUTS OF

rings, weapons, an iron cross, and somebody digging out a gold tooth with a knife, being removed from dead Germans.

PVT. BUTZ (VO)

DEAD GERMANS:

PVT. BUTZ (VO)

The Basterds took their lives, their hair, their valuables, their identity, and finally their dignity in death.

True that. The sight of the dead soldiers with bare feet does rob the tableau of a certain dignity that is normally felt in battlefield shots.

BACK TO HITLER:

HITLER:

He fights his frustration, then . . .

HITLER:

Continue.

BACK TO THE BASTERDS

Aldo screams to the Basterd who’s guarding the two German prisoners.

LT. ALDO

Hey, Hirschberg, send that kraut sarge over.

BASTERD PFC. HIRSCHBERG

KICKS Sgt. Rachtman in the back.

PFC. HIRSCHBERG

You! Go!

Sgt. Rachtman is a little slow to respond. So Hirschberg grabs him by the hair, YANKS him to his feet, and KICKS him in the ass, sending him on his way.

Most of the Basterds sit in a circle, Indian style, with Aldo in the middle.

As Sgt. Rachtman walks toward this circle of Basterds,

An OFFSCREEN LITERARY NARRATOR (not Pvt. Butz) speaks over the SOUNDTRACK in ENGLISH:

NARRATOR (VO)

Sergeant Werner Rachtman has seen many interrogations since Germany decided it should rule Europe. But this is the first time he’s ever been on the wrong end of the exchange.

It’s always been his belief that

only a weakling in mind, body, and spirit

complies with the enemy under threat of consequence. As Werner watched men cry like women,

pleadingly offer their knowledge, in exchange for their worthless lives, he made a vow to himself.

If his role is to die in this conflict, when they put him under the earth,

his dignity would be buried with him. For in the other world, the gods only respect the ones they test first.

Well, Sergeant, this is your test. And the gods are watching.

The captured German sergeant enters the circle of Basterds, stands straight before the sitting southern lieutenant, and salutes his captor.

SGT. RACHTMAN

(ENGLISH)

Sgt. Werner Rachtman.

Aldo returns the salute, looking at up him.

LT. ALDO

Lt. Aldo Raine. Pleased to meet cha.

You know what sit down means, Werner?

SGT. RACHTMAN

Yes.

LT. ALDO

Then sit down.

The German sergeant does.

LT. ALDO

How’s your English, Werner? Cause if need be, we gotta couple fellas

can translate.

Aldo points at one of the Basterds in the circle,

CPL. WILHELM WICKI.

LT. ALDO

Wicki there, an Austrian Jew, got the fuck outta Salzberg while the

gettin’ was good. Became American, got drafted, and came back to give y’all what for.

Then Aldo points to another Basterd. A big, scary-looking Basterd, in a German sergeant’s uniform, named SGT. HUGO STIGLITZ.

LT. ALDO

And another one over there you

might be familiar with, Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz. Heard of ’em?

The two German sergeants look at each other.

SGT. RACHTMAN

Everybody in the German army’s heard of Hugo Stiglitz.

The Basterds laugh, and a couple pat Hugo on the back.

The NARRATOR comes back on the SOUNDTRACK.

NARRATOR (VO) The reason for Hugo Stiglitz’s celebrity among German soldiers is simple.

WE SEE A PHOTO OF HUGO on the front page of the Nazi version of Stars and Stripes (the military newspaper).

NARRATOR (VO)

As a German enlisted man, he killed thirteen Gestapo officers, mostly

majors.

WE SEE THE MILITARY PHOTOS OF ALL THIRTEEN GESTAPO OFFICERS.

NARRATOR (VO)

Instead of putting him up against

a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin, to be made an example of.

Hugo in chains, being put in a lone troop truck, part of a prison convoy, en route to Berlin.

NARRATOR (VO)

Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.

EXT—FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE—DAY

The Basterds AMBUSH the prison convoy, killing everybody.

They walk to the back of the troop truck. Inside, Hugo, in chains, stares back at them.

LT. ALDO

Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz?

Hugo nods.

LT. ALDO

I’m Lt. Aldo Raine, and these are the Basterds. Ever heard of us?

Hugo nods his head, yes.

LT. ALDO

We just wanna say, we’re a big fan of your work. When it comes to killin’ Nazis, I think you show great talent, and I pride myself on havin’ an eye for that kind of talent. But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur. We all came here to see if you wanna go pro?

BACK TO THE BASTERD CIRCLE.

LT. ALDO

Now Werner, I’m gonna assume you know who we are?

SGT. RACHTMAN

Aldo the Apache.

The circle of Basterds giggle.

LT. ADLO

Well, Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain’t in the

prisoner-takin’ business. We in the killin’ Nazi business. And cousin, business is boomin’.

The Basterds laugh.

LT. ALDO

Now that leaves two ways we can play this out. Either kill ya or let ya

go. Now whether or not you gonna leave this circle alive depends entirely on you.

Aldo takes out a map of the area and lays it out in front of his prisoner.

LT. ALDO

Up the road a piece, there’s a

orchard. ’Sides you, we know there’s another kraut patrol fuckin’ around

here somewhere. Now if that patrol

were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper’s delight. Now if you ever wanna eat

a sauerkraut sandwich again, you gotta show me on this map where

they are, you gotta tell me how many they are, and you gotta tell me

what kinda artillery they carrying with ’em.

SGT. RACHTMAN

You can’t expect me to divulge information that would put German

lives in danger.

LT. ALDO

Well, Werner, that’s where you’re wrong. Because that’s exactly what I expect.

I need to know about Germans hidin’ in trees. And you need to tell me. And you need to tell me, right now. Now take your finger and point out

on this map where this party’s bein’ held, how many’s comin’, and what they brought to play with.

Werner sits, head held high, back straight, chin up, every inch the German hero facing death.

SGT. WERNER

I respectfully refuse, sir.

Aldo jerks his thumb behind him.

LT. ALDO

You see that ole boy battin’ rocks?

WE RACK-FOCUS to one of the Basterds not in the circle. He’s wearing a wife beater and power-hitting stones with a baseball bat.

Werner’s eyes go to the ballplayer.

LT. ALDO

That’s Sgt. Donny Donowitz. But you might know him better by his nickname, the Bear Jew. Now if you heard of

Aldo the Apache, you gotta heard about the Bear Jew?

SGT. RACHTMAN

I heard.

LT. ALDO

What did you hear?

SGT. RACHTMAN

He beats German soldiers with a club.

LT. ALDO

He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.

SGT. DONOWITZ

back to us, still haven’t seen his face. He Babe Ruths a rock soaring into the atmosphere.

LT. ALDO

Now, Werner, I’m gonna ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still “respectfully refuse,” I’m calling the Bear Jew over here, and he’s gonna take that big bat of his, and he’s gonna beat your ass to death with it.

Now take your Wiener-schnitzel-lickin’ finger and point out on this map

what I want to know.

SGT. RACHTMAN

Fuck you and your Jew dogs.

Instead of getting mad, the Basterds burst out LAUGHING.

Also says to Werner, with a giggle in his voice:

LT. ALDO

Actually, Werner, we’re all tickled

ya said that. Frankly, watchin’ Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest

we ever get to goin’ to the movies. (YELLING)

DONNY!

SGT. DONOWITZ

He turns to the CAMERA and yells:

SGT. DONOWITZ

Yeah?

Got a German here wants to die for his country.

Oblige him.

INT—SPORTING GOODS STORE—DAY

MR. GOOROWITZ’S sporting goods shop in Donny’s Jewish Boston neighborhood. Donny walks in.

MR. GOOROWITZ

Hello, Donny. How are you?

DONNY:

Ah, just dandy, Mr. Goorowitz.

MR. GOOROWITZ

Your mother, your father—everything good there?

DONNY:

They’re just fine. I’m shippin’ off next week.

The store proprietor extends his hand to the young man.

MR. GOOROWITZ

Good for you, son. Kill one of those Nazi basterds for me, will ya?

DONNY:

That the idea, Mr. Goorowitz.

MR. GOOROWITZ

What can I do you for, Donny?

DONNY:

I need a baseball bat.

The store owner leads him to a basket with eight bats in it. Donny starts going through them without saying anything.

Mr. Goorowitz watches.

MR. GOOROWITZ

You gettin’ your little brother a present before you ship out?

Donny, concentrating on the bats, not looking up:

DONNY:

No.

Donny’s “no” silences the gabby Goorowitz. He seems to settle on one, feeling its weight in his hands.

DONNY:

Can I try this one on for size, outside?

Extending his arm:

MR. GOOROWITZ

Be my guest.

The phone rings.

MR. GOOROWITZ

I’ll get that. You go right ahead.

The proprietor answers the phone and gets into a conversation with his OFFSCREEN mother.

Donny walks outside. WE STAY IN STORE but can see him clearly through the store’s big picture window.

However, Mr. Goorowitz instinctively turns his back to Donny to speak with his mother.

Donny starts swinging the bat. It’s pretty obvious he’s pantomiming beating somebody to death with it. Then

he starts yelling:

DONNY:

Take that, ya Nazi basterd! You like

fuckin’ with the Jews? Wanna fuck with the Jews? The American Jews are gonna FUCK with you . . . !

Mr. Goorowitz sees none of this as he speaks to his

mother. He hangs up the phone just as Donny walks back into the store. The store owner turns to the store customer.

DONNY:

Is this the heaviest ya got?

CUT TO:

INT—HALLWAY APARTMENT BUILDING—DAY

Donny, dressed nice, in an apartment building in his Jewish Boston neighbourhood. He knocks on a door.

A VERY OLD JEWISH WOMAN opens the door, only a little, peering out at the young man.

OLD WOMAN:

How can I help you?

DONNY:

Mrs. Himmelstein?

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

State your business, young man.

DONNY:

Mrs. Himmelstein, I’m Donny Donowitz.

My father, Sy Donowitz, owns the barber shop on

Greeny Ave. Sy’s Barber Shop.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

I’ve seen it. Do you live in the neighborhood?

DONNY:

All my life.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

Again, state your business?

DONNY:

May I have a word with you?

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

What about?

DONNY:

Our people in Europe.

She thinks for a beat, then holds the door open for the young man.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

Come in. Would you like some tea?

INT—MRS. HIMMELSTEIN’S APARTMENT—DAY

Donny sits on an overstuffed sofa, holding a tea cup and

saucer in his hand. Mrs. Himmelstein sits on an overstuffed chair, holding her tea, looking across at her visitor.

DONNY:

(sipping tea)

Very good.

MRS. HIMMSELSTEIN

If you like tea.

Donny chuckles at her little joke. The old woman remains

stone. She wasn’t joking. He places his saucer on the coffee table and begins:

DONNY:

Mrs. Himmelstein, do you have any loved ones over in Europe who you’re concerned for?

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

What compels you, young man, to ask a stranger such a personal question?

DONNY:

Because I’m going to Europe. And I’m gonna make it right.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

And just how do intend to do that, Joshua?

He holds up his bat.

DONNY:

With this.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

And what exactly do you intend to do with that toy?

DONNY:

I’m gonna beat every Nazi I find to death with it.

She takes another sip of tea.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

I thought we were having tea together.

Donny picks up his cup and takes a sip.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

And in this pursuit, how is it that I can be of service?

DONNY:

I’m going through the neighborhood.

If you have any loved ones in Europe whose safety you fear for, I’d like

you to write their name on my bat.

BACK TO BASTERDS

Donna takes a long walk to Werner . . .

PVT. BUTZ

watches all this . . .

As WE CUT BACK and FORTH BETWEEN DONNY WALKING and WERNER WAITING, WE ALSO CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN DONNY and

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN . . .

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

You must be a real basterd, Donny.

DONNY:

You bet your sweet ass I am.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN

Hand me your sword, Gideon. I do believe I will join you on this journey.

She signs the BAT: “MADELEINE.”

Donny steps up to the plate, looking down at the Nazi:

He sees the Iron Cross hanging from the German Sgt’s right pocket. The Jew taps the German’s medal with the end of his bat.

DONNY:

You get that for killing jews?

SGT RACHTMAN:

Bravery.

Donny gives him a “oh yeah, we’ll see about that,” look.

The Bear Jew raises the bat up high over his shoulder and brings it down hard against the side of Rachtman’s head.

Donny BEATS Werner TO DEATH WITH THE BAT, to the cheers of the Basterds.

PVT. BUTZ

watches. Hirschberg says to him:

PFC. HIRSCHBERG

About now, I’d be shittin’ my pants, if I was you.

Aldo points a finger at Butzs and crooks it toward him.

A crying, visibly shaken Butz sits down in front of Aldo.

LT. ALDO

You wanna live?

PVT. BUTZ

Yes, sir.

LT. ALDO

Point out on this map the German position.

His arm shoots out like a rocket and points out the positions.

PVT. BUTZ

This area here.

LT. ALDO

How many?

PVT. BUTZ

Maybe twelve.

LT. ALDO

What kind of artillery?

PVT BUTZ:

They have a machine gun dug in here pointing north.

BACK TO HITLER:

HITLER:

How did you survive this ordeal?

WE SEE Pvt. Butz in the Führer’s room for the first time.

He wears a Nazi cap, which is unusual in the presence of the Führer, but he seems okay with it.

PVT. BUTZ

They let me go.

FROM HERE ON WE GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ALDO AND HITLER.

LT. ALDO

Now, when you report what happened here, you can’t tell ’em you told us what you told us. They’ll shoot ya. But they’re gonna wanna know, why you so special, we let you live? So tell ’em we let ya live so you could spread the word through the ranks what’s gonna happen to every Nazi we find.

HITLER:

You are not to tell anybody anything! Not one word of detail! Your outfit

was ambushed, and you got away. Not one more word.

PVT. BUTZ

Yes, mein Führer.

Pause.

HITLER:

Did they mark you like they did the other survivors?

PVT. BUTZ

Yes, mein Führer.

HITLER:

Remove your hat and show me.

LT. ALDO

Now say we let ya go, and say you survive the war? When you get back

home, what ’cha gonna do?

PVT. BUTZ

I will hug my mother like I’ve never hugged her before.

LT. ALDO

Well, ain’t that a real nice boy. Are you going to take off your uniform?

PVT. BUTZ

Not only shall I remove it, but I intend to burn it!

The young German is telling Aldo what he thinks Aldo wants to hear. But the last answer didn’t go down as well as he thought it would, as is evident by the frown on Aldo’s face.

LT. ALDO

Yeah, that’s what we thought. We don’t like that. You see, we like our Nazis

in uniforms. That way, you can spot ’em just like that.

(snaps his fingers)

But you take off that uniform, ain’t nobody gonna know you was a Nazi.

And that don’t sit well with us.

Aldo removes a LARGE KNIFE from a sheath on his belt.

LT. ALDO

So I’m gonna give ya a little somethin’ you can’t take off.

BACK TO HITLER:

Pvt. Butz removes his combat helmet. Hair hangs in his face. He moves it aside, and WE SEE a SWASTIKA has been HAND-

CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD.

BACK TO BASTERDS BUTZ’S POV

on ground, looking up at them. Aldo has just carved the swastika, and he’s holding the bloody knife. All the Basterds crowd around to admire his handiwork.

SGT. DONOWITZ

You know, Lieutenant, you’re getting pretty good at that.

LT. ALDO

You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don’t cha? Practice.

FADE TO BLACK:

OVER BLACK:

CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:

CHAPTER THREE:

“GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS”

INT—CINEMA AUDITORIUM—NIGHT

We’re in the auditorium of a cinema in Paris. However, the

CAMERA is pointed in the direction of the audience, not the screen. We start CLOSE on the projector beam emanating from

the little glass window in the back of the theater.

The CAMERA continues to DOLLY back, making the shot wider and wider, bringing in more and more the German-occupied citizens of Paris, who stare at the OFFSCREEN silver screen in the dark.

We can hear the OFFSCREEN SOUNDTRACK of a Goebbels-produced German omm-pa-pa musical movie being projected.

The shot continues to pull farther and farther back, and the German dialogue continues to fill the auditorium . . .

UNTIL . . .

The DOLY SHOT LANDS on a CLOSEUP of Shosanna, watching the movie.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS:

“SHOSANNA DREYFUS

TWO WEEKS AFTER THE MASSACRE

OF SHOSANNA’S FAMILY”

We hear the sound of the German musical’s climax.

The lights go up in the auditorium.

Shosanna, dressed in a NURSE’S UNIFORM she swiped from

somewhere, remains seated, as the rest of the PATRONS gather their coats and file out.

EXT—LITTLE CINEMA (PARIS)—NIGHT

Patrons exit under the cinema marquee, as someone from inside SHUTS OFF the marquee’s lights.

The MARQUEE READS in French:

“GERMAN NIGHT BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK in MADCAP IN MEXICO.”

EXT—PROJECTION BOOTH (LITTLE CINEMA)

A French black man, who we will learn later is named MARCEL,

is the cinema’s projectionist. We see him for a moment, taking the film reels off the projector and placing them on rewinds.

INT—AUDITORIUM

CU SHOSANNA:

Still sitting in her seat. Except for her, the auditorium is empty.

The owner of the cinema, an attractive-looking French woman, who we will later know as MADAME MIMIEUX, appears in

one of the cinema’s opera-box balconies.

Looking down from her porch at the young girl, sitting in the empty cinema.

The DIALOGUE will be spoken in FRENCH and SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

So, young woman, since it’s beyond obvious we’re closed for the evening, I must assume you want something. What can I do for you?

SHOSANNA:

May I sleep here tonight?

MADAME MIMIEUX:

So I gather you’re not a nurse?

SHOSANNA:

No.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

But you’re a bright little thing. That’s a clever disguise. Where is your family?

SHOSANNA:

Murdered.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

So you’re a war orphan?

SHOSANNA:

We were from Nancy. The Boches found us—

MADAME MIMIEUX:

—Is this a sad story?

SHOSANNA.

Oui.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

Sad stories bore me. These days everyone in Paris has one. I haven’t bored you with mine. Don’t bore me with yours.

SHOSANNA:

You can run the machines?

MADAME MIMIEUX:

What machines?

Using her hands to pantomime the rotating film reels on a projector, she says:

SHOSANNA:

The machines that show the film.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

The projectors? Yes, I own a cinema.

Of course I can operate them.

SHOSANNA:

I know, I saw you.

FLASH ON:

CU SHOSANNA:

eyes creeping up the stairway in the projection booth, watching . . .

MADAME MIMIEUX:

expertly working the projectors . . .

BACK TO SHOSANNA

SHOSANNA:

Teach me. Teach me to run the machines that show the film. It’s only you and

the negro. I know you could use some help.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

I know at least six people who’ve been put up against a wall and machine-

gunned for sheltering enemies of the state. I have no intention of being unlucky number seven. How long have

you been in Paris?

SHOSANNA:

A week and a few days.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

How have you survived the curfew without capture?

SHOSANNA:

I sleep on rooftops.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

Again, I’m forced to admit, clever girl. How is it?

SHOSANNA:

Cold.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

(laughs)

I can imagine.

SHOSANNA:

Respectfully, no you can’t.

Pause.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

Fair enough.

Thinks . . .

MADAME MIMIEUX:

So you can’t operate a 35mm film projector. You want me to teach you, in order to work here, in order to use my cinema as a hole to hide in. Is that correct?

SHOSANNA:

Oui.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

What’s your name?

SHOSANNA:

Shosanna.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

I’m Madame Mimieux. You may call me Madame. This is a cinema. Not a home for wayward war orphans.

Having said that, what you say is true. If you were truly exceptional, I could find use for you. So, Shosanna, are you truly exceptional?

SHOSANNA:

Oui, Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

I will be the judge of that.

DISSOLVE TO:

TITLE CARD:

Which shows a lovely PENCIL SKETCH of the CITY OF PARIS, complete with Eiffel Tower.

ABOVE IT READS:

“1944

PARIS”

THEN . . .

The CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we see we’re not looking at a TITLE CARD at all, but a CALENDER stuck on the wall of the little cinema’s projection booth. Before we leave it, WE SEE the

month is JUNE . . .

The CAMERA finds the THREE-YEARS-OLDER SHOSANNA working

as the PROJECTIONIST. It would appear that Shosanna passed Madame Mimieux’s exceptional test.

Alyrical, Morricone-like tune PLAYS on the SOUNDTRACK. This will be “Shosanna’s Theme.”

A little bell begins RINGING on one of the projectors, alerting Shosanna its time for a REEL CHANGE.

Shosanna stands at the projector, watching the old German film she’s projecting, waiting for the FIRST REEL CHANGE MARK . . .

SILVER:

SCREEN:

of the

little

cinema. Onscreen

LENI RIEFENSTAHL lies

horizontal as

an icicle drips on her head in the old

German

film “The White Hell of

Pitz Palu.”

The FIRST REEL

CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the upper-right-

hand corner of

the FRAME (that

tells the projectionist

to get

ready).

As the FILM REEL on the FIRST PROJECTOR rolls out, Shosanna stands ready, waiting by the SECOND PROJECTOR . . .

WHEN . . .

SILVER SCREEN:

the SECOND REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the same place (that’s the one).

SHOSANNA:

THROWS the lever on the SECOND PROJECTOR, switching the film from projector 1 to projector 2, executing a perfect REEL CHANGE.

As “Shosanna’s Theme” plays on the soundtrack, we watch, via MONTAGE, her go through her daily chores: carry heavy film cans up the stairs, empty the rat traps, etc, etc. . . .

EXT—CINEMA—NIGHT

The MARQUEE READS in French:

“GERMAN NIGHT LENI RIEFENSTAHL in PABST’S WHITE HELL OF PITZ PALU”

Shosanna emerges from the cinema carrying two buckets of LETTERS (for the marquee) and a tall ladder. Her chore here, obviously, is to change the show on the marquee.

The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack in ENGLISH:

NARRATOR (VO)

To operate a cinema in Paris during

the occupation, one had two choices. Either you could show new German propaganda films, produced under the watchful

eye of Joseph Goebbels. Or . . . you could have a German night in your weekly schedule and show allowed German classic films.

Their German night was Thursday.

Shosanna, by herself, perched up high on the ladder, changing the letters on the marquee.

A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER (about the same age as Shosanna) walks out of the cinema. He sees the ladder with the young French girl on top and walks over.

They speak FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

GERMAN SOLDIER:

What starts tomorrow?

Shosanna looks down, seeing the young German soldier smiling up at her from below.

SHOSANNA:

A Max Linder festival.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Ummm, I always preferred Linder to Chaplin. Except Linder never made a

film as good as “The Kid.” The chase climax of “The Kid,” superb.

Shosanna continues working, not adding to the conversation.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

I suppose now you could use an M, an A, and an X?

SHOSANNA:

No need, I can manage.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Don’t be ridiculous. It’s my pleasure.

He hands the French damsel the letters spelling MAX.

SHOSANNA:

Merci.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

I adore your cinema very much.

SHOSANNA:

Merci.

She busies herself with the marquee letters . . .

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Is it yours?

SHOSANNA:

Do I own it?

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Oui.

SHOSANNA:

Oui.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

How does a young girl such as yourself own a cinema?

Due to his uniform and Shosanna’s situation, his efforts at trying to make small talk strike the young Jewess in hiding as a Gestapo interrogation.

SHOSANNA:

My aunt left it to me.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Lucky girl.

Shosanna makes no reply back.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Merci for hosting a German night.

SHOSANNA:

I don’t have a choice, but you’re welcome.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Do you choose the German films yourself?

SHOSANNA:

Oui.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Then my merci stands. I love the Riefenstahl mountain films, especially “Pitz Palu.” It’s nice to see a French girl who’s an admirer of Riefenstahl.

SHOSANNA:

“Admire” would not be the adjective

I would use to describe my feelings toward Fräulein Riefenstahl.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

But you do admire the director Pabst, don’t you? That’s why you included

his name on the marquee.

She climbs down from the ladder and faces the German private.

SHOSANNA:

I’m French. We respect directors in our country.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Apparently even Germans.

SHOSANNA:

Even Germans. Merci for your assistance,

Private. Adieu.

She turns to go back inside.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

You’re not finished?

SHOSANNA:

I’ll finish in the morning.

She opens the door to go inside.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

May I ask your name?

SHOSANNA:

You wish to see my papers?

She hands him her excellently forged papers.

That’s obviously not what he meant, but he takes them anyway to read her name.

COL. LANDA

Emmanuelle Mimieux. That’s a very pretty name.

SHOSANNA:

Merci. Are you finished with my papers?

He hands them back.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Mademoiselle. My name is Frederick Zoller.

She gives no response.

GERMAN SOLDIER:

It’s been a pleasure chatting with a fellow cinema lover. Sweet dreams, Mademoiselle.

He gives her a little salute and walks into the black of a curfew- imposed night.

She looks after him. She didn’t show it, but he kind of got to her. After all, for any true cinema lover, it’s hard to hate anybody who, CINEMA MON AMOUR.

EXT—ROOFTOP CINEMA—NIGHT

Shosanna stands on the roof her her cinema, late at night, lighting up a cigarette. As she takes her first big drag,

she remembers a voice.

FLASH ON:

MADAME MIMIEUX, the younger Shosanna, and the black projectionist, Marcel, in the projection booth. Shosanna

lights up a cigarette, and Madame Mimieux SLAPS her face HARD, knocking the cigarette out of her mouth. Marcel quickly STAMPS it out on the floor.

MADAME:

MIMIEUX:

If I ever see

you light

up a cigarette in my

cinema again,

I’ll turn

you in to the Nazis, do

you understand?

Shosanna is shocked by this statement.

SHOSANNA:

Oui, Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

And for bringing an open flame into my cinema, you deserve far worse than a Nazi Jewish boxcar. With your thick head, what do you think the highest priority of a cinema manager is? Keeping this fucking place from burning down to the ground, that’s what!

In my collection, I have over three hundred and fifty 35mm, nitrate film prints, which are not only immensely flammable but highy unstable. And should they catch fire, they burn three times faster than paper. If that happens . . .

POOF . . . all gone, cinema no more, everybody burned alive. If I ever

see you with an open flame in my cinema again, I won’t turn you into the Nazis. I’ll kill you myself. And the fucking Germans will give me a curfew pass.

Do you understand me?

SHOSANNA:

Oui, Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

Do you believe me?

SHOSANNA:

Oui, Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX:

You damn well better.

BACK TO ROOF:

Shosanna exhales cigarette smoke.

Marcel comes onto the roof.

MARCEL:

Are you well?

SHOSANNA:

Even on the roof I can’t smoke a cigarette without hearing Madame’s

voice yelling at me. That’s why I

do it. To hear Madame’s voice again.

MARCEL:

We both miss her.

SHOSANNA:

I know. I’m fine, darling. I’ll be to bed soon.

Marcel goes back inside. Shosanna smokes.

INT—FRENCH BISTRO—AFTERNOON

Shosanna sits in the back of a French bistro, reading a book, “The Saint in New York,” by Leslie Charteris, drinking wine when the young German soldier from the other day,

FREDRICK ZOLLER, walks in. He gets a beer, then notices the French girl sitting in the back. He smiles and heads over

to her. “Oh no, not this guy again,” she thinks.

Again they speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

FREDRICK:

May I join you?

SHOSANNA:

Look, Fredrick—

FREDRICK:

(smiling)

—You remember my name?

SHOSANNA:

Yes . . . Look, you seem a pleasant enough fellow—

FREDRICK:

—Merci.

SHOSANNA:

You’re welcome. Regardless, I want you to stop pestering me.

FREDRICK:

I apologize, Mademoiselle. I wasn’t trying to be a pest. I was simply

trying to be friendly.

SHOSANNA:

I don’t wish to be your friend.

FREDRICK:

Why not?

SHOSANNA:

Don’t act like an infant. You know why.

FREDRICK:

I’m more than just a uniform.

SHOSANNA:

Not to me. If you are so desperate for

a French girlfriend, I suggest you try Vichy.

Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously very impressed with Fredrick. They make a fuss over him in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which neither Shosanna or the non-German- speaking members of the movie’s audience can understand.

He signs autographs for them and shakes their hands, and they go on their way.

Shosanna’s eyes narrow.

SHOSANNA:

Who are you?

FREDRICK:

I thought I was just a uniform.

SHOSANNA:

You’re not just a German soldier. Are you somebody’s son?

FREDRICK:

Most German soldiers are somebody’s son.

SHOSANNA:

Yeah, but you’re not just somebody. What are you, Hitler’s nephew?

He leans in across the table. She leans in too, and he says:

FREDRICK:

Yes.

SHOSANNA:

Really?

FREDRICK:

No, not really. I’m just teasing you.

She leans back, annoyed.

SHOSANNA:

Then what is it? What are you, a German movie star?

FREDRICK:

Not exactly.

SHOSANNA:

(Pfuit) What does that mean, “not exactly”? I asked if you were a movie star. The answer to that question is yes or no.

Fredrick laughs at that line.

FREDRICK:

When you said that just now, you reminded me of my sister.

This catches young Shosanna off guard.

FREDRICK:

I come from a home of six sisters.

We run a family-operated cinema in Munich. Seeing you run around your cinema reminds me of them. Especially my sister Helga. She raised me, when our father wasn’t up to the job. I admire her very much. You’d like her. She doesn’t wear a German uniform.

SHOSANNA:

You were raised by Helga?

FREDRICK:

All my sisters. I’m the baby, but Helga was the bossiest.

SHOSANNA:

And your mother and father?

FREDRICK:

My mother

died. And my father

was a

loser. My

father’s

motto:
“If

at first

you don’t

succeed,

quit.” The

day he

left,

good riddance.

My sisters

are

all I

need. It’s

why

I like your cinema.

It makes me feel

both

closer

to

them

and a

little homesick

at the

same time.

SHOSANNA:

Is your cinema still operating?

FREDRICK:

Oui.

SHOSANNA:

What’s it called?

FREDRICK:

The Kino Haus.

SHOSANNA:

How has it done during the war?

FREDRICK Actually, in Germany, cinema attendance is up.

SHOSANNA:

No doubt. You don’t have to operate under a curfew.

FREDRICK:

How often do you fill your house?

SHOSANNA:

(Pfuit) Not since before the war.

FREDRICK:

So if you had one big engagement, that would help you out?

SHOSANNA:

Of course, but that’s not likely to happen.

TWO MORE:

GERMAN:

SOLDIERS and their

TWO:

FRENCH:

DATES:

approach

the table. They

ask for

Fredrick’s

autograph,

and he signs it for

them. One of the French

girls

says, in

FRENCH, how exciting

it is to

meet a

real live

German war hero. Shosanna

hears

it. They

leave.

So that’s

it,

she thinks.

SHOSANNA:

So you’re a war hero? Why didn’t you tell me?

FREDRICK:

Everybody knows that. I liked that you didn’t.

SHOSANNA:

What did you do?

He takes a sip of beer.

FREDRICK:

I’ve shot the most enemy soldiers in World War Two . . . so far.

You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.

SHOSANNA:

Wow.

FREDRICK:

I was alone in a bell tower in a walled-off city in Russia. It was myself and a thousand rounds of ammo in a bird’s nest, against three hundred Soviet soldiers.

SHOSANNA:

What’s a bird’s nest?

FREDRICK:

A bird’s nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower. It’s a high structure, offering a three-hundred-and-sixty-degree view. Very advantageous for marksmen.

SHOSANNA:

How many Russians did you kill?

FREDRICK:

Sixty-eight.

(beat)

The first day. A hundred and fifty the second day. Thirty-two the third day.

On the fourth day, they exited the city. Naturally my war story received a lot of attention in Germany. That’s why they all recognize me. They call me the German Sergeant York.

SHOSANNA:

Maybe they’ll make a film about your exploits.

FREDRICK:

Well, that’s just what Joseph Goebbels thought. So he did. It’s called “Nation’s Pride,” and guess what, they wanted me to play myself, so I did. They have posters for it in kiosks all over Paris. That’s another reason for all the attention.

SHOSANNA:

“Nation’s Pride” is about you? “Nation’s Pride” is starring you?

FREDRICK:

I know, comical, huh?

SHOSANNA:

Not so comical. So what are you doing in Paris, enjoying a rest?

FREDRICK:

Hardly. I’ve been doing publicity, having my pictures taken with different German luminaries, visiting troops,

that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the film to premiere in Paris, so I’ve been helping them in the planning.

Joseph is very keen on this film.

He’s telling anybody who will listen that when “Nation’s Pride” is released

I’ll be the German Van Johnson.

Shosanna isn’t falling for the young German by any stretch. However, his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can’t help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as “Joseph,” like they’re friends, is all she needs to get on the right side of things. This young man is trouble with a capital T, and

she needs to stay far fucking away from him.

She abruptly rises and says:

SHOSANNA:

Well, good luck with your premiere, Private. I hope all goes well for

Joseph and yourself. Au revoir.

And with that, she disappears, leaving the perplexed private alone.

EXT—CINEMA MARQUEE—DAY

It’s the next day.

Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee.

Marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet.

Shosanna is alone outside the little cinema, perched up on her ladder.

WHEN . . .

. . . A BLACK NAZI SEDAN pulls up in front of the little cinema.

A GERMAN MAJOR in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of the back of the sedan.

The DRIVER, a German private, steps out as well.

Yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder:

Both GERMAN and FRENCH will be SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH.

GESTAPO MAJOR:

Mademoiselle Mimieux?

SHOSANNA:

Oui?

Telling his driver in German to ask her in French:

GESTAPO MAJOR:

Ask her if this is her cinema.

In French the driver asks Shosanna:

DRIVER:

Is this your cinema?

SHOSANNA:

Oui.

GESTAPO MAJOR:

Tell her to come down.

DRIVER:

Come down, please.

She climbs down the ladder.

The driver opens the back door of the sedan, indicating for her to get in.

SHOSANNA:

I don’t understand. What have I done?

DRIVER:

(to major)

She wants to know what she’s done?

GESTAPO MAJOR:

Who says she’s done anything?

DRIVER:

Who says you’ve done anything?

Then in her best imitation of Mademoiselle Mimeux’s arrogant manner.

SHOSANNA:

Then I demand to know what this is about, and where do you propose to take me?

The driver begins to translate when the Gestapo major holds up his hand, telling him not to bother. The major looks at the young French girl and tells her in German:

GESTAPO MAJOR:

Get your ass in that car.

No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car, followed by the Germans. The sedan takes off.

INT—SEDAN (MOVING)—DAY

The Nazi sedan drives through the early-afternoon Paris streets.

WE HOLD SHOSANNA IN TIGHT CU

the whole ride, never showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside her. We just hold on her face trying not to reveal anything.

The sedan stops.

The car door opens, and the driver offers Shosanna his hand.

EXT/INT—MAXIM’S (FAMOUS PARIS CAFÉ)—DAY

She steps out of the car and is led into a Paris café by the Gestapo officer. It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before she realizes she’s not being led to a Gestapo interrogation room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but to lunch.

The best table at Maxim’s. Three people, and two dogs, sit at it: Germany’s minister of propaganda and the number-two man in Hitler’s Third Reich, JOSEPH GOEBBELS; his female French translator (and mistress), FRANCESCA MONDINO; and young Private Zoller.

TWO BLACK FRENCH POODLES belonging to Mademoiselle Mondino sit together in another chair at the table.

We join the in mid-conversation:

They all speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

GOEBBELS:

—it’s only the offspring of slaves that

allows America to be competitive athletically. American Olympic gold can be measured

in Negro sweat.

Shosanna is led through the French eatery by the Gestapo major. Private Zoller sees her and stands up, excuses himself,

and greets her before she reaches the table.

Fredrick says in French, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

FREDRICK:

Good you came. I wasn’t sure whether or not you’d accept my invitation.

SHOSANNA:

Invitation?

THEN . . .

. . . Goebbels’s voice says OFFSCREEN:

GOEBBELS (OS)

Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?

Private Zoller turns in his direction, takes Shosanna by the arm, and leads her to him.

FREDRICK:

Yes, it is, Herr Goebbels. Emmanuelle, there is somebody I want you to meet.

Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons crème brûlée into his mouth.

The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda minister formally.

FREDRICK:

Emmanuelle Mimieux, I’d like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda, the leader of the entire German film industry, and now I’m an actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels.

Goebbels offers up his long, spiderlike fingers for Shosanna to shake. She does.

GOEBBELS:

Your reputation precedes you, Fräulein Mimieux.

He looks to Francesca to translate, but she’s just taken a big bite of tiramisu.

They all laugh.

Frederick jumps in . . .

FREDRICK:

And normally, this is Herr Goebbels’s French interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.

FRANCESCA:

looks up at Shosanna.

NARRATOR’S VOICE comes on soundtrack:

NARRATOR (VO)

Francesca Mondino is much more than Goebbels’s French interpreter.

She’s also Goebbels’s favorite French actress to appear in his films . . . . .

FLASH ON:

FRENCH CLIP:

from one of Francesca’s B/W Goebbels produced productions.

Francesca, dressed as a French peasant girl, with a YOUNG GERMAN (MOVIE) SOLDIER.

She speaks in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

FRANCESCA/PEASANT GIRL

I love you, I can’t help it. My country or my heart, which do I betray?

A SUBTITLE APPEARS below naming the film’s title:

“SENTIMENTAL COMBAT” (1943)

FLASH ON:

Francesca and Goebbels having sex in her boudoir, on her red velvet bed.

NARRATOR (VO)

And Goebbels’s favorite French mistress, to act in his bed.

WE SEE JUST A SUPER-QUICK SHOT OF Goebbels FUCKING Francesca DOGGY-

STYLE.

FRANCESCA:

(animal-like) Do it! Do it! Fuck me—fill me!

BACK TO FRANCESCA looking at Shosanna.

FRANCESCA:

Bonjour.

SHOSANNA:

Bonjour.

FREDRICK:

And you’ve met the major.

The Gestapo officer steps up and says to Fredrick in German:

GESTAPO MAJOR:

Actually, I didn’t introduce myself. (to Shosanna)

Major Dieter Hellstrom of the Gestapo, at your service, Mademoiselle.

(he clicks his heels)

Please allow me. Have a seat.

The Gestapo officer pulls out a chair for the young lady to sit down. Shosanna takes the hot seat. Seated to her right is Pvt. Zoller. To her left are the two curly, pampered poodles. Major Hellstrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine from a small carafe on the table.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Try the wine, Mademoiselle. It’s quite good.

Goebbels looks across the table at her.

GOEBBELS:

Well, I must say, you’ve made quite an impression on our boy.

Francesca interprets Goebbels’s German for Shosanna.

GOEBBELS:

I must say, Fräulein, I should be rather annoyed with you.

Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS:

I arrive in France, and I wish to have lunch with my star . . .

Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS Little do I know he’s become the toast of Paris, and now he must find time for me.

Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS:

People wait in line hours, days, to see me. For the Führer and Private Zoller, I wait.

Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS:

So finally, I’m granted an audience

with the young private, and he spends the entire lunch speaking of you

and your cinema.

Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS:

So Fräulein Mimieux, let’s get down to business.

Private Zoller interrupts—

FREDRICK:

Herr Goebbels, I haven’t informed her yet.

GOEBBELS:

Unless the girl’s a simpleton, I’m sure she’s figured it out by now. After all, she does operate a cinema. Francesca, tell her.

Francesca tells Shosanna in French:

FRANCESCA:

What they’re trying to tell you, Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has

spent the last hour at lunch,

trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels

to abandon previous plans for Private Zoller’s film premiere and change the venue to your cinema.

Zoller reacts.

FRANCESCA:

(FRENCH to Zoller)

What?

FREDRICK:

I wanted to inform her.

FRANCESCA:

Shit. I apologize, Private. Of course you did.

GOEBBELS:

(GERMAN to Francesca) What’s the issue?

FRANCESCA:

The young soldier wanted to inform the mademoiselle himself.

GOEBBELS:

Nonsense. Until I ask a few questions, he has nothing to inform. Let the record state, I have not agreed to a venue change.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Duly noted.

Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna:

GOEBBELS:

You have opera boxes?

SHOSANNA:

Oui.

GOEBBELS:

How many?

SHOSANNA:

Three.

GOEBBELS:

More would be better. How many seats in your auditorium?

SHOSANNA:

Three hundred and fifty.

GOEBBELS:

That’s almost four hundred less than The Ritz.

Fredrick jumps in . . .

FREDRICK:

But Herr Goebbels, that’s not such a terrible thing. You said yourself you didn’t want to indulge every two-faced French bourgeois taking up space currying favor. With less seats it makes the event more exclusive. You’re not trying to fill the house, they’re fighting for seats.

FREDRICK:

(CON’T)

Besides, to hell with the French. This is a German night, a German event, a German celebration. This

night is for you, me, the German military, the High Command, their

family and friends. The only people who should be allowed in the room are people who will be moved by the exploits onscreen.

Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit of a pause:

GOEBBELS:

I see your public speaking has improved. It appears I’ve created

a monster. A strangely persuasive monster. When the war’s over,

politics awaits.

Table chuckles.

GOEBBELS:

Well, Private, though it is true

I’m inclined to indulge you anything, I must watch a film in this young lady’s cinema before I can say

yes or no.

(to Shosanna)

So, young lady, you are to close your cinema tonight and have

a private screening for me.

Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS:

What German films do you have?

Francesca asks . . .

SHOSANNA:

My cinema, on German night, tends to show older German classics.

Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS:

Why not my films?

Francesca asks . . . ?

SHOSANNA:

I draw an older German audience in my cinema that appreciates the nostalgia of an earlier time.

Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS:

That’s nonsense, Fräulein. We Germans are looking forward, not backward. That era of German cinema is dead. The German cinema I create will not only be the cinema of Europe, but

the world’s only alternative to the degenerate Jewish influence of

Hollywood.

Fredrick jumps in . . .

FREDRICK:

Along with being a cinema owner, Emmanuelle is quite a formidable

film critic.

He chuckles, but alone.

GOEBBELS:

So it would appear. Unfortunately for the Fräulein, I’ve outlawed film criticism.

Zoller, thinking fast, says:

FREDRICK:

Why don’t you screen “Lucky Kids”? I’m sure Emmanuelle hasn’t seen it. And it’s so funny. I’ve been meaning to recommend it to her, for her German night. That’s a great idea. Let’s watch “Lucky Kids” tonight.

GOEBBELS:

Ahhh, “Lucky Kids,” “Lucky Kids,” “Lucky Kids.” When all is said and

done, my most purely enjoyable production. Not only that, I

wouldn’t be surprised if sixty years from now, it’s “Lucky Kids” that I’m the most remembered for.

I know it doesn’t seem like it now, but mark my words.

Very well, I’ll have a print sent over to the Fräulein’s cinema. We’ll screen “Lucky Kids” tonight.

As Francesca interprets this for Shosanna . . .

the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly filled with the bottom half of a gray S.S. officer uniform.

GOEBBELS:

Ah, Landa, you’re here. This is the young lady in question.

The S.S. officer sits down, and it’s our old friend from the first scene, COL. HANS LANDA.

FREDRICK:

Emmanuelle, this is Col. Hans Landa of the S.S. He’ll be running security for the premiere.

CU SHOSANNA:

A bomb is dropped and detonated behind her eyes. But if she gives any indication of this, her war story ends here.

The S.S. OFFICER

who murered her family takes her hand and kisses it, saying in perfect French:

COL. LANDA

Charmed, Mademoiselle.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Better known as “the Jew Hunter.”

The table laughs.

GOEBBELS:

Oh, Francesca, what was that funny thing the Führer said about Hans?

FRANCESCA:

What thing?

GOEBBELS:

You know, you were there. It was a funny thing the Führer said,

about Hans . . . something about a pig?

Francesca’s memory is jogged.

FRANCESCA:

Oh, yes, of course.

She repeats it by whispering it in Goebbels’s ear.

GOEBBELS:

Oh, yes, of course, that’s it. So the Führer said he wouldn’t be surprised if Hans weren’t rooting out Jews like a truffle pig from the playpen.

FRANCESCA:

That’s what we need, pigs that can root out Jews.

COL. LANDA

Who needs pigs when you have me?

Big, hearty laugh around the table.

GOEBBELS:

Do you have an engagement tonight?

COL. LANDA

Well, as a matter of fact, I do—

GOEBBELS:

—Break it. We’re all going to the fräulein’s cinema tonight to view

“Lucky Kids.”

COL. LANDA

Splendid.

Then the Reich minister’s companion, Mademoiselle Mondino, interrupts:

FRANCESCA:

And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels to his next appointment.

GOEBBELS:

Slave driver! French slave driver!

They all chuckle.

Everybody begins to stand up from the table . . .

Francesca gathers the stupid dogs . . .

As Col. Landa stands, he says:

COL. LANDA

Actually, in my role as security

chief of this joyous German occasion, I’m afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.

Mademoiselle Mimieux’s eyes go to Private Zoller, who responds.

FREDRICK:

What sort of discussion?

COL. LANDA

That sounded suspiciously like

a soldier questioning the order of a colonel? Or am I just being sensitive?

FREDRICK:

Nothing could be further from the truth, Colonel. Your authority is beyond question.

But your reputation precedes you. Should Mademoiselle Mimieux or myself be concerned?

GOEBBELS:

Hans, the boy means no harm, he’s simply smitten. And he’s correct. Your reputation does precede you.

Laughter all around. The Reich minister and his Axis entourage make their way to front of the café, with the two dumb dogs on

a leash, leading the way.

COL. LANDA No need for concern, you two.

As security chief, I simply need to have a chat with the possible new venue’s property owner.

FREDRICK:

I was just hoping to escort Mademoiselle Mimieux back to her cinema.

GOEBBELS:

Nonsense! You can eat ice cream and walk along the Seine another time. Right now, allow Col. Landa to do his job.

Everybody says their farewells.

Col. Landa offers the young Jew in hiding a seat at a small table in the outside patio area of Maxim’s.

The fluency and poetic proficiency of the S.S. Jew hunter’s French reveals to the audience that his feigning clumsiness at French with Monsieur LaPadite in the film’s first scene was simply an interrogation technique.

They speak FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA

Have you tried the strudel here?

SHOSANNA:

No.

COL. LANDA

It’s not so terrible. So how is it the young private and yourself came to be acquainted?

She’s about to answer when a WAITER approaches.

COL. LANDA

Yes, two strudels, one for myself and one for the mademoiselle. A cup of espresso, with a container of steamed milk on the side.

For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk.

Considering that Shosanna grew up on a dairy farm, and the last time she was on a dairy farm her strudel companion murdered her entire family, his ordering her milk is, to say the

least . . . disconcerting.

The key to Col. Landa’s power and/or charm, depending on the side one’s on, lies in his ability to convince you he’s privy to your secrets.

The waiter exits.

COL. LANDA

So, Mademoiselle, you were beginning to explain . . . ?

SHOSANNA:

(anxiously) Up until a couple of days ago,

I had no knowledge of Private Zoller or his exploits. To me, the private

was simply just a patron of my cinema. We spoke a few times, but—

COL. LANDA

—Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you. This is a simple formality, no

reason for you to feel anxious.

The strudel arrives.

The colonel takes one look at it and says to the waiter:

COL. LANDA

I apologize. I forgot to order the crème fraîche.

WAITER:

One moment.

He exits.

COL. LANDA

(referring to

the crème.)

Wait for the crème

(back to

business)

So, Emmanuelle—May I call you Emmanuelle?

SHOSANNA:

Oui.

COL. LANDA

So, Emmanuelle, explain to me how does it happen that a young lady such as yourself comes to own a cinema?

The waiter returns, applying crème fraîche to the two strudels.

The S.S. colonel looks across the table at his companion. Picking up his fork, he says:

COL. LANDA

After you.

Shosanna takes a whipped-creamy bite of strudel. Landa follows her lead.

COL. LANDA

(mouthful

of strudel)

Success?

Shosanna, mouth full of strudel, indicates she approves.

COL. LANDA Like I said, not so terrible.

(back to

business)

So you were explaining the origin of your cinema ownership?

SHOSANNA:

The cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle—

Col. Landa removes a little black book from his pocket.

COL. LANDA

—What are their names?

SHOSANNA:

Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.

He records the names in his little book.

COL. LANDA

Where are they now?

SHOSANNA:

My uncle was killed during the blitzkrieg.

COL. LANDA

Pity . . . Continue.

SHOSANNA:

Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring.

COL. LANDA

Regrettable.

(respectful

pause)

It’s come to my attention you have

a negro in your employ. Is that true?

SHOSANNA:

Yes, he’s a Frenchman. His name is Marcel. He worked with my aunt and

uncle since they opened the cinema. He’s the only other one who works with me.

COL. LANDA

Doing what?

SHOSANNA:

Projectionist.

COL. LANDA

Is he any good?

SHOSANNA:

The best.

COL. LANDA

Actually, one could see where that might be a good trade for them. Can you operate the projectors?

SHOSANNA:

Of course I can.

COL. LANDA

Knowing the Reich Minister as I do, I’m quite positive he wouldn’t want

the success or failure of his illustrious evening dependent on

the prowess of a negro. So if it comes to pass that we hold this event at your venue—talented, no doubt,

as your negro may be—you will

operate the projectors. Is that acceptable?

As if she has any say.

SHOSANNA:

Oui.

Col. Landa takes another bite of strudel, and Shosanna follows suit.

COL. LANDA

So it would appear our young hero is quite smitten with you?

SHOSANNA:

Private Zoller’s feelings for me aren’t of a romantic nature.

COL. LANDA

Mademoiselle . . . ?

SHOSANNA:

Colonel, his feelings are not romantic. I remind him of his sister.

COL. LANDA

That doesn’t mean his feelings aren’t romantic.

SHOSANNA:

I remind him of his sister who raised him.

COL. LANDA

It’s sounding more and more romantic by the minute.

Landa takes out a handsome-looking cigarette case, with an S.S. LOGO on it. Removing one of the fags, he lights it up with a fancy S.S. gold lighter. He offers one to Shosanna.

COL. LANDA

Cigarette?

SHOSANNA:

No, thank you.

COL. LANDA

Do you smoke?

SHOSANNA:

Yes.

COL. LANDA

Then I insist, you must take one. They’re not French, they’re German.

I hope you’re not nationalist about

your tobacco. To me, French cigarettes are a sin against nicotine.

She takes one but makes no move to light it.

He inhales deeply and says:

COL. LANDA

I did have something else I wanted to ask you, but right now, for the

life of me, I can’t remember what it is. Oh, well, must not have been important.

Col. Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table, puts on his gray S.S. cap, touches his finger to his visor, saluting Shosanna, and says:

COL. LANDA

Till tonight.

And with that he’s gone.

Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief.

The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her feet and ankles and the floor. We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine. During her conversation and strudel with the man who exterminated her entire family, Shosanna pissed herself.

She drops the German cigarette into the piss puddle by her feet.

INT—CINEMA AUDITORIUM—NIGHT

The SILVER SCREEN

Onscreen is the German screwball comedy “LUCKY KIDS.”

We hear OFFSCREEN laughter at the onscreen Aryan antics.

CU GOEBBELS:

watching the screen, basking in his own toxic genius.

CU FRANCESCA:

laughing at the comedy, hand covering her mouth.

CU TWO BLACK POODLES

pantingly watching the screen.

CU MAJOR HELLSTROM

smiling, smoking a German cigarette.

CU COL LANDA:

smoking a German cigarette, amused.

CU FREDRICK ZOLLER truly enjoying himself.

CU SHOSANNA:

watching the screen.

The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.

NARRATOR (VO)

While Shosanna sits there pretending

to be amused by the Aryan antics of Goebbel’s Frank Capra copy “Lucky

Kids,” a thought suddenly comes to her.

We see her face get slightly distracted behind the eyes.

NARRATOR (VO)

What if tonight, accidently, the

cinema burned down? The Third Reich would lose its minister of

propaganda, its national hero, and its top Jew hunter, all in one fell swoop.

She chuckles at THAT thought, though it looks like she’s chuckling at the German comedy.

NARRATOR (VO)

But then that thought . . .

. . . led Shosanna To a crazy idea.

The idea flashes on her face.

Then Shosanna bursts out laughing.

Zoller looks over at her. Happy.

She’s enjoying the movie.

SILVER SCREEN:

“The END” card for “Lucky Kids” is projected.

The Nazi rouges’ gallery, and Shosanna, applaud the film.

The lights go up.

Goebbels accepts congratulations, as they stand and begin to file out into the lobby.

NARRATOR (VO)

The screening of “Lucky Kids” was a complete success. And Herr Goebbels conceded to have the venue changed

to Shosanna’s cinema. Not only that,

in a moment of inspiration, Herr Goebbels had an idea.

Goebbels speaks GERMAN, and Francesca translates:

GOEBBELS:

I must say, I appreciate the modesty of this auditorium. Your cinema

has real respect, almost churchlike. Not to say we couldn’t spruce the place up a bit. In Versailles there’s a crystal chandelier hanging in the banquet hall that is extraordinary. We’re going to get it and hang it from the very middle of

the auditorium roof. Also I want to go to the Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes,

and just scatter them about the lobby.

MONTAGE:

We see a quick series of shots that show all that happening.

The chandelier being removed from the ceiling of Versailles.

Greek nude statues being hand-trucked out of the Louvre.

A truck driving through the French countryside with the enormous crystal chandelier in the back.

The lobby of Shosanna’s cinema, pimped out in Nazi iconography. WORKERS buzz around decorating. The Greek statues are moved into place.

We see workers trying with incredible difficulty to hoist the huge, heavy, and twinkingly fragile chandelier in Shosanna’s auditorium, which now resembles something out of one of Tinto Brass’s Italian B-movie ripoffs of Visconti’s “The Damned.”

SHOSANNA:

watches all this from an opera box. She shakes her head in disbelief.

BACK TO SHOSANNA AND THE NAZIS

in the lobby, post screening of “Lucky Kids.” She’s soundlessly escorting them to the door as they make their good-byes.

NARRATOR (VO) As they left the little French cinema that night, all the Germans were very happy . . .

We see Pvt. Zoller hanging back, so he can say good-bye.

NARRATOR (VO)

None more so than Fredrick Zoller.

She closes the door on him, watching the Nazis walk into Paris night. Their shadows for a moment on the wall, look like grotesque Nazi caricatures.

The Nazis are gone.

Marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby, looking down at Shosanna.

They speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

MARCEL:

What the fuck are we supposed to do?

SHOSANNA:

It looks like we’re supposed to have a Nazi premiere.

MARCEL:

Like I said, what the fuck are we supposed to do?

SHOSANNA:

Well, I need to speak with you about that.

MARCEL:

About what?

SHOSANNA:

About these Hun swine, commandeering our cinema.

MARCEL:

What about it?

She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel. She makes him part his legs and sits on the lower step, between his legs, her

back up against his chest, his arms around her shoulders, Shosanna has only known this type of intimacy with Marcel.

SHOSANNA:

Well, when I was watching that Boche (said in English)

Capra-corn abomination, (back to French)

I got an idea.

MARCEL:

I’m confused. What are we talking about?

SHOSANNA:

Filling the cinema with Nazis and their whores, and burning it down to the ground.

MARCEL:

I’m not talking about that. You’re talking about that.

SHOSANNA:

No, we’re talking about that, right now. If we can keep this place from burning down by ourselves, we can burn it down by ourselves.

MARCEL:

Shosanna—

SHOSANNA:

No, Marcel, just for the sake of argument, if we wanted to burn down the cinema

for any number of reasons, you and I could physically accomplish that, no?

MARCEL:

Oui, Shosanna, we could do that.

SHOSANNA:

And with Madame Mimieux’s three hundred and fifty nitrate film print collection,

we wouldn’t even need explosives, would we?

MARCEL:

You mean we wouldn’t need any more explosives?

SHOSANNA:

Oui, that’s exactly what I mean.

She begins kissing his hands.

SHOSANNA:

(CON’T)

I am going to burn down the cinema on Nazi night.

One of his fingers probes her mouth.

SHOSANNA:

(CON’T)

And if I’m going to burn down the cinema, which I am, we both know

you’re not going to let me do it by myself.

The back of her head presses up hard against him, as his hand both caresses and grips her lovely neck.

SHOSANNA:

(CON’T)

Because you love me. And I love you.

And you’re the only person on this earth I can trust.

She then TWISTS around so she’s straddling him. They are now face to face.

SHOSANNA:

(CON’T)

But that’s not all we’re going to do. Does the filmmaking equipment in the attic still work? I know the film

camera does. How about the sound recorder?

MARCEL:

Quite well, actually. I recorded a new guitarist I met in a café last week. It works superb. Why do we need filmmaking equipment?

SHOSANNA:

Because Marcel, my sweet, we’re going to make a film. Just for the Nazis.

She gives him a deep French kiss.

FADE TO BLACK:

BLACK FRAME:

CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:

CHAPTER FOUR:

“OPERATION KINO”

FADE OFF:

INT—ENGLISH COUNTRY ESTATE—DAY

A young MILITARY ATTACHÉ opens the sliding double doors that serve as an entrance to the room.

MILITARY ATTACHÉ

Right this way, Lieutenant.

A snappy, handsome British lieutenant in dress brown steps inside the room. This officer, who has been mixing it up with

the Gerrys since the late thirties, is LT. ARCHIE HICOX,

a young George Sanders type (“The Saint” and “Private Affairs of Bel Ami” years).

Upon entering the room, Lt. Hicox is gobsmacked.

Standing before him is legendary military mastermind

GEN. ED FENECH, an older George Sanders type (“Village of the Damned”).

But in the back of the room, sitting behind a piano, smoking his ever-present cigar, is the unmistakable bulk of WINSTON CHURCHILL.

The lieutenant was not expecting him.

Hicox salutes the general.

LT. HICOX

Lieutenant Hicox reporting, sir.

GEN. FENECH

(salutes back)

General Ed. Fenech. At ease, Hicox. Drink?

Hicox’s eyes go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano, who’s scrutinizing him behind his cigar. However, the man behind the cigar makes no gesture, and the general makes no acknowledgment of the three-hundred-pound gorilla in the room. Which Lt. Hicox knows enough to mean, if Churchill isn’t introduced, he ain’t there.

LT. HICOX

If you offered me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and

plain water.

GEN. FENECH

That a boy, Lieutenant. Make it yourself, like a good chap,

will you? Bar’s in the globe.

Hicox heads over to the bar globe.

LT. HICOX

Something for yourself, sir?

GEN. FENECH

Whiskey straight. No junk in it.

The lieutenant moves over to the Columbus-style globe bar and busies himself mixing spirits, playing bartender chappy.

Fenech, eyeing the lieutenant’s file.

GEN. FENECH It says here you’ve run three

undercover commando operations in Germany and German-occupied

territories? Frankfurt, Holland, and Norway, to be exact?

Back to them, mixing drinks, he says:

LT. HICOX

Extraordinary people, the Norwegians.

GEN. FENECH

It says here you speak German fluently?

LT. HICOX

Like a Katzenjammer Kid.

GEN. FENECH

And your occupation before the war?

His back still to us, as he bartends . . .

LT. HICOX

I’m a film critic.

GEN. FENECH

List your accomplishments?

LT. HICOX

Well, sir, such as they are, I write reviews and articles for a publication called “Films and Filmmakers.”

As well as our sister publication.

GEN. FENECH

What’s that called?

LT. HICOX

“Flickers Bi-Monthly,” and I’ve had two books published.

GEN. FENECH

Impressive. Don’t be modest, Lieutenant. What are their titles?

LT. HICOX

The first book was called “Art of the Eyes, the Heart, and the Mind: A Study of German Cinema in the Twenties.”

And the second one was called . . .

He turns around with his whiskey and plain water and the general’s whiskey no junk. He finishes what he was saying, as

he walks toward the general, handing him his drink.

LT. HICOX “Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci.” It’s a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G. W. Pabst.

He hands the general his whiskey.

LT. HICOX

What should we drink to, sir?

GEN. FENECH

(thinking, for

a moment)

Down with Hitler.

LT. HICOX

All the way down, sir.

CLINK.

GEN. FENECH

Are you familiar with German cinema under the

Third Reich?

LT. HICOX

Yes. Obviously I haven’t seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I am familiar with it.

GEN. FENECH

Explain it to me.

LT. HICOX

Pardon, sir?

GEN. FENECH

This little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German

film industry under the Third Reich. Explain to me UFA, under Goebbels?

LT. HICOX

Goebbels considers the films he’s making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema—an alternative to what he considers the Jewish

German intellectual cinema of the twenties and the Jewish-controlled

dogma of Hollywood.

SUDDENLY . . . bellowing from the back of the room:

CHURCHILL:

How’s he doing?

LT. HICOX

Frightfully sorry, sir, once again?

CHURCHILL:

You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game? Compared to, say,

. . . Louis B. Mayer . . . how’s he doing?

LT. HICOX

Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels

has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the

last eight years. But Louis B. Mayer wouldn’t be Goebbels’ proper opposite number. I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.

Gen. Fenech looks to the prime minister.

With a puff of cigar smoke, Churchill says:

CHURCHILL:

Brief him.

GEN. FENECH

Lt. Hicox, at this point in time I’d like to brief you on Operation Kino. Three days from now, Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris—

LT. HICOX

—What film, sir?

The general has to resort to peeking at his file.

GEN. FENECH

The motion pictures called “Nation’s Pride.”

LT. HICOX

Oh, you mean the film about Private Zoller?

GEN. FENECH

We don’t have any intelligence on exactly what the film that night

will be about.

LT. HICOX

But it’s called “Nation’s Pride”?

GEN. FENECH

Yes.

LT. HICOX

I can tell you what it’s about.

It’s about Private Fredrick Zoller.

He’s the German Sargeant York.

Fenech can’t help suppress a smile. They have the right man.

GEN. FENECH

In attendance at this joyous Germanic occasion will be Goebbels, Goering, Boormann, and most of the German High Command, including all the high-ranking officers of both the S.S. and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda-film industry.

LT. HICOX

The master race at play, aye?

GEN. FENECH

Basically, we have all our rotten

eggs in one basket. The objective of Operation Kino . . . Blow up the basket.

LT. HICOX

(reciting a

poem)

. . . and like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth. Jolly good, sir.

GEN. FENECH

An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines

will be your assist. The Germans call them “the Basterds.”

LT. HICOX

“The Basterds.” Never heard of them.

GEN. FENECH

Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.

But the Gerrys have heard of them, because

these Yanks have

been them

the devil. Their

leader is

a chap

named Lieutenant

Aldo Raine. The

Germans call him

“Aldo the

Apache.”

LT. HICOX

Why do they call

him that?

GEN. FENECH

Best guess is because he removes the scalps of the Nazi dead.

LT. HICOX

Scalps, sir?

GEN. FENECH

The hair.

He runs his finger along his hairline.

GEN. FENECH

Like a red Injun.

LT. HICOX

Rather gruesome-sounding little dickybird, isn’t he?

GEN. FENECH

No doubt the whole lot, a bunch of nutters. But you’ve heard the

expression “It takes a thief.”

LT. HICOX

Indeed.

Gen. Fenech continues on with his exposition, moving over to a military map.

GEN. FENECH

You’ll be dropped into Franch about twenty-four kilometers outside of Paris. The Basterds will be waiting for you. First thing, you go to a little village called Nadine.

(He points it out on the map.)

Apparently the Gerrys never go there. In Nadine, there’s a tavern called La Louisiane. You’ll rendezvous

with our double agent, and she’ll take it from there. She’s the one who’s

going to get you into the premiere. It will be you, her, and two German- born members of the Basterds. She’s

also made all the other arrangements you’re going to need.

LT. HICOX

How will I know her?

GEN. FENECH

I suspect that won’t be too much

trouble for you. Your contract is Bridget von Hammersmark.

LT. HICOX

Bridget von Hammersmark? The German movie star is working for England?

GEN. FENECH

For the last two years now. One could even say Operation Kino was her brainchild.

In the back of the room the bulldog barks:

CHURCHILL:

Extraordinary woman.

LT. HICOX

Quite.

GEN. FENECH

You’ll go to the premiere as her escort, lucky devil. She’ll also have the premiere tickets for the other two. Got the gist?

LT. HICOX

I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.

The three British bulldogs laugh.

EXT—CINEMA ROOFTOP—DAY

Shosanna and Marcel are on the rooftop of their cinema literally making a movie.

Marcel is behind an old (even then) BOLEX 35MM MOVIE CAMERA, positioned low, looking up.

Shosanna, the camera subject, stands on boxes looking down into it.

A old-timey MICROPHONE is positioned out of frame.

As they always do, and always will, they speak FRENCH SUBTITLED into you know what.

MARCEL:

We need a sync mark.

SHOSANNA:

What is a sync mark?

MARCEL:

An action and noise put together, So we can sync up the picture and sound.

SHOSANNA:

How do we do that?

MARCEL:

Clap your hands.

She does.

MARCEL:

In frame, imbecile.

She claps her hands in front of her face.

MARCEL:

Ready?

Shosanna takes a deep breath, then:

SHOSANNA:

Ready.

MARCEL:

Action.

WE CUT, BEFORE SHE SPEAKS, TO . . .

THE SCENE EARLIER BETWEEN MARCEL AND SHOSANNA IN THE

LOBBY, ON THE STAIRS, TALKING ABOUT BURNING DOWN THE CINEMA.

Big difference. This time, it’s in COLOR.

MARCEL:

But how do we get it developed?

Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop that footage. How do we get

a 35mm print with a soundtrack?

SHOSANNA:

Do you know one person who can do both things?

MARCEL:

Of course, Gaspar. Very nice man,

took care of all the experimental filmmakers. But nobody in their

right mind would strike a print of what you’re talking about. If the Nazis found out, their life wouldn’t be worth this.

He snaps his fingers.

SHOSANNA:

In a wolf fight, you either eat the

wolf or the wolf eats you. If we’re going to obliterate the Nazis,

we have to use their tactics.

MARCEL:

What does that mean?

SHOSANNA:

We find somebody who can develop and process a 35mm print. And we make them do it or we kill them.

Once we tell them what we want to do if they refuse, we have to kill them anyway or they’ll turn us in.

MARCEL:

Would you do that?

SHOSANNA:

Like that.

Snaps her fingers.

INT—SMALL FILM-PROCESSING LAB—LATE NIGHT

Aold mom-and-pop film processing lab circa the thirties. Late late at night.

GASPAR, the fatherly figure of all the experimental French filmmakers in the decade before German rule, takes a SAVAGE BEATING at the hands of his friend Marcel.

Shosanna watches, pitiless.

SHOSANNA:

Bring that fucker over here!

Put his head down on that table.

Marcel holds Gaspar’s arm behind him as he forces his head flat against the tabletop.

Shosanna brings a HATCHET DOWN DEEP into the table, just by his face.

SHOSANNA:

You either do what the fuck we tell you to, or I’ll bury this ax in your collaborating skull.

GASPAR:

I’m not a collaborator!

SHOSANNA:

Then prove it! Or does your manhood

go no deeper than standing to piss? Marcel, do his wife and children

know you?

MARCEL:

Oui.

SHOSANNA:

Then after we kill this dog for

Germans, we’ll go and silence them.

She lifts up the hatchet, raises it high . . .

SHOSANNA:

Prepare to die, collaborator fucker!

CUT TO:

GASPAR:

hands the couple a SMALL SILVER CAN OF 35MM FILM, Outside the shop window, it’s morning.

INT—PROJECTION ROOM

WE SEE the five heavy silver film cans of Fredrick Zoller’s life story, “Nation’s Pride” (clearly marked), on the floor of the projection booth.

The can for REEL 4 is open and empty.

Shosanna’s at the editing bench. REEL 4 is up on the rewinds . . .

Shosanna SPLICES her and Marcel’s footage into REEL 4 of Fredrick’s film, rewinds it, puts it back in the can, and

puts a piece of RED TAPE on the REEL 4 CAN.

She walks out of the booth, turning off the lights behind her, PLUNGING THE SCREEN INTO DARKNESS.

BLACK FRAME:

FROM BLACK DISSOLVE TO

EXT—LA LOUISIANE (TAVERN)—NIGHT

We see a small basement tavern with an old rustic sign out front that reads “La Louisiane.”

A SUBTITLE APPEARS:

“The village of Nadine, France”

TWO SHOT LT. HICOX and LT. ALDO RAINE

Aldo is dressed like a French civilian. Hicox is dressed in a German gray S.S. captain’s uniform. They look out of a window, in an apartment, in the village of Nadine, overlooking the tavern.

LT. ALDO

You didn’t say the goddamn rendezvous was in a fuckin’ basement.

LT. HICOX

I didn’t know.

LT. ALDO

You said it was in a tavern?

LT. HICOX

It is a tavern.

LT. ALDO

Yeah, in a basement. You know, fightin’ in a basement offers a lot of difficulties, number one being you’re fighting in a basement.

Wilhelm Wicki joins the SHOT, dressed in a German S.S. lieutenant’s uniform.

WICKI:

What if we go in there and she’s not even there?

LT. HICOX

We wait. Don’t worry. She’s a British spy.

She’ll make the rendezvous.

WE SEE that the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes, are in the room as well. They are Donowitz, Hirschberg,

and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the gray uniform of an S.S. lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself, sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt, looped around his boot. Anybody not in the scene from the Basterd’s opening chapter is dead.

Lt. Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of the room SHARPENING his dagger menacingly.

Stiglitz is fucking weird . . .

Lt. Hicox approaches Stiglitz . . .

LT. HICOX

Stiglitz, right?

STIGLITZ:

That’s right, sir.

He continues bringing the blade’s edge up, then down on the leather strap.

LT. HICOX

I hear you’re pretty good with that?

Meaning the blade.

Stiglitz doesn’t answer.

LT. HICOX

You know, we’re not looking for trouble right now. We’re simply making contact with our agent.

Should be uneventful. However, on

the off chance I’m wrong and things prove eventful, I need to know we can all remain calm.

The renegade Gerry sergeant stops his blade’s progress and looks up at the limey lieutenant.

STIGLITZ:

I don’t look calm to you?

LT. HICOX

Well, now you put it like that, I guess you do.

He turns his attention back to his blade.

Hicox moves over to Aldo and asks him privately:

LT. HICOX

This Gerry of yours, Stiglitz? Not exactly the loquacious type, is he?

Aldo just looks at him.

LT. ALDO

Is that the kinda man you need, the loquacious type?

LT. HICOX

Fair point, Lieutenant.

LT. ALDO

So y’all git in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?

Make bets on how it all comes out?

LT. HICOX

If we get into trouble, we can handle it. But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn

sure no Germans or French, for that matter— escape from that basement.

If Fräulein von Hammersmark’s cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.

Donny chimes in:

SGT. DONOWITZ

Speaking of Fräulein von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the death trap rendezvous?

LT. HICOX

She chose the spot.

SGT. DONOWITZ

Well, isn’t that just dandy?

LT. HICOX

Look, she’s not a military strategist. She’s just an actress.

LT. ALDO Ya don’t got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don’t want to fight in a basement.

LT. HICOX

She wasn’t picking a place to fight. She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.

PFC. HIRSCHBERG

Lieutenant, I hate to be contrary, but I got me a Nazi pissin’ on Louisiana two o’clock.

They move to the window, and sure enough, ONE LONE NAZI PRIVATE relieves himself against the side wall.

Lt. Hicox, this was definitely not the plan.

LT. HICOX

Shit.

Sgt. Donowitz chides him:

SGT. DONOWITZ

So what do you think your Fräulein von Hammer—

LT. HICOX

—Obviously, I don’t know, Sergeant.

The British officer watches the German soldier, who’s not supposed to be there. When Hugo Stiglitz joins him at the window, Stiglitz looks down at the urinating Nazi, S.S. dagger in hand.

STIGLITZ:

If we’re going, let’s go.

He sheaths the dagger.

EXT—LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)—NIGHT

The GERMAN PISSING PRIVATE sloppily finishes his task. Cramming his noodle back in his pants, he descends the stairs that lead him back into the basement tavern. We follow him . . .

INT—LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)—NIGHT

Inside the basement tavern La Louisiane. It has a very low-hanging basement ceiling. A old-looking wood bar off to the right. And the only other space in the little tavern is taken

up by two large (at least in here) tables, which take up both halves of the room. And despite rumors to the contrary, one of the two tables is completely filled with drunken, celebrating

Nazi enlisted men, of which our urinating friend is one of five.

FIVE NAZIS:

ONE GERMAN MASTER SERGEANT, ONE FEMALE GERMAN SERGEANT (a powerfully built, stocky type), and THREE MALE GERMAN SOLDIERS.

The five Nazis are sitting around the table, drinking, and playing a very fun game with none other than the Fräulein of the hour, UFA diva BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK, dressed to the

nines in a chic, forties-style woman’s suit, complete with fedora. The game they’re playing consists of each player having

a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary, stuck to their forehead. The player doesn’t know what name is on their forehead. So they ask the others questions to figure out who they are.

The five Germans’ five cards read: MASTER SGT #1: (POLA NEGRI);

FEMALE SGT #2:
(BEETHOVEN); GERMAN PRIVATE #3: (MATA HARI);

GERMAN PRIVATE #4: (EDGAR WALLACE); GERMAN PRIVATE #5: (WINNETOU). And Bridget von Hammersmark, who wears her card in

the brim of her fedora, has GENGHIS KHAN.

It’s German #5’s (WINNETOU) turn to ask questions.

The DIALOGUE will be in GERMAN and SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH.

WINNETOU:

. . . okay, I’m not German. Am I American?

The whole table bursts out laughing.

FEMALE SGT. BEETHOVEN

Yes, you are!

EDGAR WALLACE:

Well, not really.

SGT. POLA NEGRI What do you mean, not really? Of course he is.

EDGAR WALLACE:

Well, if he’s so American, how come he’s never been translated into

English. He’s not American. He’s supposed to be American, but he’s not

an American creation. In fact, he’s something very different.

WINNETOU:

Okay, I’m a fictional, literary character, from the past. I’m American, and that’s controversial.

BRIDGET/GENGUS

No, it’s not controversial. The nationality of the author has nothing to do with

the nationality of the character. The character is the character. Hamlet’s not British, he’s Danish. So, yes, this character was born in America.

WINNETOU:

Well, I’m glad that’s settled. If I had a wife, would she be called a squaw?

He’s got it.

The table laughs.

THE TABLE:

YES!

WINNETOU:

Is my blood brother Old Shatterhand?

THE TABLE:

Yes!

WINNETOU:

Did Karl May write me?

THE TABLE:

Yes!

In the BACKGROUND, WE SEE our three counterfeit German officers—Hicox, Wicki, and Stiglitz—enter the basement

tavern. They obviously see the five German soldiers, but they’re too far away for us (the audience) to read their faces. No doubt they’re less than happy. Fräuhlein von Hammersmark

sees them as well. Without getting up, she waves to them.

BRIDGET:

Hello, my lovelies. I will join you in moments. I’m finishing up a game with my five new friends here.

LT. HICOX

No hurry, Fräulein von Hammersmark.

Take your time. Enjoy yourself.

BRIDGET:

(to Winnetou)

So who are you?

WINNETOU:

I am WINNETOU, CHIEF of the APACHES!

The table CHEERS and APPLAUDS the Apache chief as he takes the card off his forehead.

The other four German soldiers drink down their beer (part of the game).

Bridget von Hammersmark knocks back her champagne.

MATA HARI:

Fräulein von Hammersmark, when your friends came in, did you realize

you did a double take, like in the movies?

BRIDGET:

Really? No, I wasn’t aware of that at all.

MATA HARI:

They must be second nature to you now. Did they teach you how to do a double take in the movies?

BRIDGET:

Well, yes, they did, but it’s not really that difficult.

SGT. POLA NEGRI

Do one for us.

The table heartily agrees.

Bridget looks directly at the master sergeant and does a perfect, and perfectly funny, double take.

The table loves it.

MATA HARI:

My turn, I want to try.

Mata Hari looks directly at Beethoven and does a double take.

EDGAR WALLACE:

I want to try.

He does.

Soon the whole table is doing dueling double takes.

HICOX—WICKI—STIGLITZ

watch the table do dueling double takes. Obviously, they don’t understand.

THEN . . .

Bridget von Hammersmark rises and excuses herself from the table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at the name for the first time. Genghis Khan.

BRIDGET:

Genghis Khan! I would never have gotten that.

She walks over and joins the masquerading Germans’ table. The gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a French cheek kiss, as if she knows them well.

They all take a seat. The two basterds and one Brit drink whiskey. The tavern’s PROPRIETOR, an older, big-bellied

Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table and pours more champagne into Bridget’s champagne glass. He leaves, returning back behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other person in the establishment.

Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

LT. HICOX

I thought this place was supposed to have more

French than Germans?

BRIDGET:

Normally that’s

true. The sergeant over there’s

wife just

had a

baby. His commanding officer

gave him and his

mates the

night

off to celebrate.

We should

leave.

WICKI:

BRIDGET:

No, we should stay. For one drink at least. I’ve been waiting for you in a bar. It would look strange if we left before we had a drink.

LT. HICOX

She’s right. Just be calm, and enjoy your booze.

BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE

The French barmaid has taken Bridget’s place in the rousing, rowdy game. She tells them her person must be French or she

won’t know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a name on a card. The barmaid puts it on her forehead. It says:

NAPOLEON.

The Germans all laugh.

BACK TO THE BASTERDS’ TABLE

BRIDGET:

There’s been some new developments.

The cinema venue has changed.

LT. HICOX

Why?

BRIDGET:

No one knows. But that in itself shouldn’t be a problem. The cinema

it’s been changed to is considerably smaller than The Ritz. So whatever materials you brought for The Ritz should be doubly effective here.

Now this next piece of information is colossal, try not to overreact.

The Führer will be attending tomorrow.

Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT-TAKE.

Bridget’s eyes bore holes in him.

BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS

They see Hugo do the spit-take and burst out laughing. Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit-takes, like they did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say, they all get wet.

BACK TO THE BASTERDS

BRIDGET:

(to Hicox)

You’ll be going as Ernst Schuller. You’ll say you’re an associate producer on Riefenstahl’s “Tiefland.” It’s the

one German production not under Goebbels’ control, and Leni wouldn’t be caught dead at a Goebbels film affair.

BACK TO THE REAL GERMAN TABLE

Master Sgt. Pola Negri drinks his beer as he looks over, dreamily, at Bridget von Hammersmark at the other table.

BACK TO THE BASTERDS

Bridget continues to brief Hicox on his identity. We see in

the B.G. the German master sergeant stand up from his table and head toward Fräulein von Hammersmark.

BRIDGET:

. . . the film’s gone through many delays, and Leni’s health is deteriorating, so if you have to speak . . .

Hicox, seeing the German master sergeant approach, signals for her to cool it.

SGT. POLA NEGRI

Fräulein von Hammersmark, I was just thinking, could you sign an autograph

to my son on his birthday?

BRIDGET:

I’d love to, Wilhelm.

(to the table)

This handsome happy sergeant just became a father today.

The pretend officers offer congratulations to the sergeant.

The German master sergeant CLICKS his heels and bows before his superior officers.

SGT. POLA NEGRI

Thank you. Heil Hitler.

He raises his hand . . . as do the seated phony officers: “Heil Hitler.”

As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch . . .

BRIDGET:

So, Wilhelm, do you know the name of this progeny yet?

SGT. POLA NEGRI

I most certainly do, Fräulein. His name is Maximilian.

Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz likes this German sergeant.

STIGLITZ:

Wonderful name, Sergeant.

SGT. POLA NEGRI

Thank you, Lieutenant. When he’s old enough to ride a bicycle, I will buy

him a blue one. And I will paint on the side “The Blue Max.”

He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheer.

They do.

Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish.

BRIDGET:

There you go. But wait, I’m not finished yet.

She reaches into her clutch and pulls out some lipstick, applies some ruby-red color to her lips, and then kisses the napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then she hands the treasured item to the young officer.

BRIDGET:

Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.

SGT. POLA NEGRI

Thank you, Fräulein, thank you. Max may not know who you are now. But he will.

I will show him all of your movies. He will grow up with your films, and this napkin on his wall.

Then, to the whole tavern . . .

SGT. POLA NEGRI

I propose a toast to the greatest actress in

Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is no

Riefenstahl, only von Hammersmark!

The whole room toasts.

This would be a good time for the German sergeant to go back to his table and his men. And he almost does . . . but . . . since he is drunk, and star struck, he out wears his welcome.

SGT. POLA NEGRI

So, Fräulein von Hammersmark, what brings you to France?

Feeling any good Nazi officer’s patience would have been exhausted long ago, Lt. Hicox butts in.

LT. HICOX

None of your business, Sergeant.

You might not have worn out your welcome with the fräulein with your drunken, boorish behavior, but you have worn out your welcome with me.

The table of game-playing soldiers hears this and gets quiet.

LT. HICOX

Might I remind you Sergeant, you’re an enlisted man. This is an officers’ table. I suggest

you stop pestering the fräulein and rejoin your table.

The German master sergeant looks quizzically at the officer.

SGT. POLA NEGRI

Excuse me, Captain, but your accent is very unusual.

The whole room pauses . . . for different reasons . . .

SGT. POLA NEGRI

Where are you from?

A silent moment passes between the two tables, then the two German- born imposters spring into action.

WICKI:

Sergeant! You must be either drunk or mad to speak to a superior officer with

such impertinence!

Stiglitz, STANDS and YELLS to the other table:

STIGLITZ:

I’m making YOU . . .

(pointing at

Winnetou)

. . . and YOU . . .

(pointing at

Edgar Wallace)

. . . responsible for him. (pointing at

Sgt. Pola)

I suggest you take hold of your friend, or he’ll spend Max’s first birthday

in jail for public drunkenness!

The Germans SPRING UP and take hold of Sgt. Pola . . .

WHEN . . .

A GERMAN VOICE rings out:

GERMAN VOICE (OS)

Then might I inquire?

The five known Germans move aside, revealing the unknown German in the room, unseen till now, our old friend from before:

MAJOR DIETER HELLSTROM of the GESTAPO. The major stands from the little table he was sitting at.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Like the young, newly christened father, I to have an acute ear for accents.

And like him, I too find yours odd. From where do you hail, Captain?

Wicki jumps in:

WICKI:

Major, this is highly inappr—

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

—I wasn’t speaking to you, Lieutenant Saltzberg,

(turning to

Stiglitz)

or you either, Lieutenant Berlin. (looking at

Hicox)

I was speaking to Captain I-don’t-know-what.

The Gestapo major is now standing beside Sgt. Pola, before the imposter’s table.

Lt. Hicox calmly explains his origin.

LT. HICOX

I was born in the village that rests in the shadow of Pitz Palu.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

The mountain?

LT. HICOX

Yes. In that village we all speak like this.

Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Yes.

LT. HICOX

Then you saw me. You remember the skiing torch scene?

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Yes, I do.

LT. HICOX

In that scene were myself, my father,

my sister, and my two brothers. My brother is so handsome, the director, Pabst, gave him a closeup.

As Bridget von Hammersmark places a cigarette in an ivory cigarette holder—which Hicox, as if on cue, lights for her

she says:

BRIDGET:

Major, if my word means anything, I can vouch for everything the young captain has just said. He does hail from the bottom of Pitz Palu, he was in the film, and his brother is far more handsome than he.

The imposters laugh.

Then . . . so does the Gestapo major. He turns to the sergeant.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

You should rejoin your friends.

Which the young sergeant is more than happy to do. That table begins playing their game again.

Major Hellstrom, the highest-ranking officer in the room, bows graciously to the female German celebrity.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

May I join you?

BRIDGET:

By all means, Major.

The Gestapo major sits at the table, opposite Lt. Hicox and Wicki. The French barmaid brings over the Major’s beer stein.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

So that’s the source of your bizarre accent? Extraordinary. So what are

you doing here, Captain?

LT. HICOX

Aside from having a drink with the lovely fräulein?

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Well, that pleasure requires no explanation.

Chuckle . . . chuckle

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

I mean in country. You’re obviously not stationed in France, or I’d know who you are.

LT. HICOX

You know every German in France?

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Worth knowing.

LT. HICOX

Well, therein lies the problem. We never claimed to be worth knowing.

Chuckle . . . chuckle.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

(chuckling as

he asks)

All levity aside, what are you doing in France?

LT. HICOX

Attending Goebbels’s film premiere as the fräulein’s escort.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

You’re the fräulein’s escort?

LT. HICOX

Somebody has to carry the lighter.

Chuckle . . . chuckle.

BRIDGET:

The captain is my date, but all three are my guests. We’re old friends, Major, who go back a long time. Longer than

an actress would care to admit.

Chuckle . . . chuckle.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Well, in that case, let me raise a glass to the three luckiest men in the room.

BRIDGET:

I’ll drink to that.

They cheers.

BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS’ TABLE

They continue to have a lot of fun playing their game.

BACK TO THE OFFICERS’ TABLE

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

I must say, that game they’re playing looks like a good bit of fun. I didn’t

join them, because you’re quite right, Captain, officers and enlisted men shouldn’t fraternize. But seeing as we’re all

officers here,

(bowing to

Bridget)

. . . and sophisticated lady friends of officers, what say we play the game?

Lt. Hicox begins to refuse when Bridget (feeling she knows better) interrupts him:

BRIDGET:

Okay, one game.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Wunderbar.

The major borrows five cards from the other table and lays them out in front of Bridget and the officers.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

So the object of the game is to write

the name of a famous person on your card. Real or fictitious, doesn’t matter. For instance, you could write Confucius or

Fu Manchu.

(He SNAPS his fingers.) Eric! More pens.

(back to the players)

And they must be famous. No Aunt Ingas. When you finish writing, put the card face down on the table and move it to the person to your left. The person to your right will move their card in

front of you. You pick up the card without looking at it, lick the back, and stick it on your forehead, like so.

He demonstrates.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

(con’t)

And in ten yes or no questions, you must guess who you are . . .

As Maj. Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the game, a CAMERA PANS OFF HIM and BEGINS SLOWLY ZOOMING INTO STIGLITZ. The major’s dialogue begins to FADE AWAY.

Until we’re in a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK. Which is RED-FILTERED FOOTAGE of Hugo being savagely WHIPPED by somebody wearing a GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSEUP.

The flashback disappears. It’s driving Stiglitz crazy, being this close to a Gestapo uniform and not plunging a knife into it.

The major’s voice comes back on the soundtrack.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

. . . So let’s give it a try, shall we? Everybody write your names.

The five players write their names . . .

Then move their cards to the left . . .

Everybody sticks their cards on their forehead . . .

MAJOR:

BRIDGET:

WILHELM:

ARCHIE:

HUGO:

HELLSTROM:

VON HAMMERSMARK:

WICKI:

KING:

BULLDOG:

BRIGITTE:

MARCO:

KONG:

PABST:

DRUMMOND:

HELM:

POLO:

MAJ. KING KONG

I’ll start, give you the idea.

Am I German?

They laugh.

BRIDGET:

No.

MAJ. KING KONG

Am I an American?

They laugh—but then Wicki says:

WICKI:

Wait a minute, he goes to—

BRIDGET:

Don’t be ridiculous. Obviously he wasn’t born in America.

MAJ. KING KONG

So . . . I visited America, aye?

The table says, “Yes.”

MAJ. KING KONG

Was this visit . . . fortuitous?

WICKI:

Not for you.

MAJ. KING KONG

. . . Hummm. My native land, is it what one would call exotic?

The table confers and decides, yes, it is exotic.

MAJ. KING KONG

Hummm. That could be either a reference to the jungle or the Orient. I’m going to let my first instinct take over and ask, am I from the jungle?

The table says, “Yes, you are.”

MAJ. KING KONG

Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask whether you’re real or fictitious.

I, however, think that’s too easy, so I won’t ask that, yet. Okay, my native land is the jungle. I visited America, but my visit was not fortuitous to me, but the implication is that it was to somebody else. When I went from the jungle to America, . . . did I go by boat?

“Yes.”

MAJ. KING KONG

Did I go against my will?

“Yes.”

MAJ. KING KONG

On this boat ride . . . Was I in chains?

“Yes.”

MAJ. KING KONG

When I arrived in America . . . was I displayed in chains?

“Yes.”

MAJ. KING KONG

Am I the story of the Negro in America?

The table says, “No.”

MAJ. KING KONG

Well, then, I must be King Kong.

He throws the card on the table.

They applaud him.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Now since I answered correctly, you all need to finish your drinks.

The three counterfeit Nazis knock back their whiskeys.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Now, who’s next?

LT. HICOX

Major, I don’t mean to be rude. But the four of us are very good friends. And the four of us haven’t seen each other in quite a while. So .

. .

Major, I’m afraid, you are intruding.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

I beg to differ, Captain. It’s only if the fräulein considers my presence an intrusion that I become an intruder.

How about it, Fräulein? Am I intruding?

BRIDGET:

Of course not, Major.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

I didn’t think so. It’s simply the young captain is immune to my charms.

The table’s not sure what to do. Is this a confrontation? Then the major laughs.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

I’m just joking. Of course, I’m intruding.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Allow me to refill your glasses, gentlemen, and I will bid you and the fräulein adieu.

(leaning in)

Eric has a bottle of thirty-three-year-old single-malt scotch whiskey from the Scottish highlands. What do you say, gentlemen?

LT. HICOX

You’re most gracious, sir.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Eric, the thirty-three and new glasses! You don’t want to contaminate the thirty-three with the swill you were drinking.

ERIC:

How many glasses?

LT. HICOX

Five glasses.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Not me. I like scotch, scotch doesn’t like me.

BRIDGET:

Nor I. I’ll stay with bubbly.

Lt. Hicox holds up three fingers (pinky to middle finger) to Eric, the owner.

LT. HICOX

Three glasses.

Eric brings the three glasses and the old bottle, pouring for the three soldiers.

Major Hellstrom lifts up his beer stein and toasts:

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

To a thousand-year Reich!

They all mutter, “a thousand-year reich” and clink glasses.

The Gestapo major puts down his beer stein, and then WE HEAR a CLICK under the table.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Did you hear that? That’s the sound of

my WALTER pointed right at your testicles.

LT. HICOX

Why do you have a Luger pointed at my testicles?

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Because you’ve just given yourself

away, captain. You’re no more German than scotch.

LT. HICOX

Well, Major—

BRIDGET:

—Major—

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

—Shut up, slut.

(to Hicox)

You were saying?

LT. HICOX

I was saying that makes two of us. I’ve had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.

SGT. STIGLITZ

That makes three of us.

UNDER THE TABLE:

We see all three guns pointed at the appropriate crotches, as well as Bridget’s legs, right besides the Nazi major’s. Her pretty gams are sure to be chewed up in the possible crossfire.

SGT. STIGLITZ

And at this range, I’m a real

Fredrick Zoller.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Hummm . . . Looks like we have a bit of a sticky situation here.

LT. HICOX

What’s going to happen, Major, is you’re going to stand up and walk out that

door with us.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

No, no,

no, no,

no, no,

I don’t think

so. I’m

afraid you

and I both know, no matter

what

happens

to

anybody else

in this room,

the two of

us aren’t going

anywhere.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

(pointing at the table

behind him)

Too bad about Sgt. Wilhelm and his friends.

If any of you expect to live, you’ll have to shoot them too.

(pause)

Looks like little Max is going to grow up an orphan. How sad.

BRIDGET:

Then, Major, I implore you. For the sake of those German troops, will you please leave with us?

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

Oh, Bridget, your concern for German troops gets me . . .

(pointing at

his heart)

. . . right here. You mean for the sake of your whore legs, don’t you? You can’t afford to get any bullet holes in them. You’re not finished spreading them for all the Hollywood Jews.

Lt. Hicox picks up his thirty-three-year-old single-malt scotch and says:

LT. HICOX (ENGLISH)

Well, if this is it, old boy, I hope you don’t mind if I go out speaking the king’s?

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

(ENGLISH)

By all means, Captain.

The English film critic commando picks up the thirty-three the Nazi major bought him and says:

LT. HICOX

There’s a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good scotch.

And seeing as I might be rapping on the door momentarily . . .

He downs the stuff.

LT. HICOX

(to the Nazi

major)

I must say, damn good stuff, sir.

He puts the glass down.

LT. HICOX Now about this pickle we find

ourselves in. It would appear there’s only one thing left for you to do.

MAJOR HELLSTROM:

(ENGLISH)

And what would that be?

LT. HICOX

Stiglitz.

STIGLITZ:

Say, “auf Widersehen” to your balls!

STIGLITZ:

FIRES into HELLSTROM’S BALLS . . .

As does HICOX, HITTING not only Hellstrom, but BRIDGET as well.

HELLSTROM:

FIRES into HICOX’s BALLS and KNEECAPS.

STIGLITZ:

then JUMPS over the table and begins STABBING HELLSTROM with the

DAGGER.

HICOX FALLS to the floor . . . DEAD.

BRIDGET FALLS to the floor . . . SHOT.

WICKI:

brings his weapon out from underneath the table and BEGINS

FIRING across at the GERMANS at the table, who, unaware, were still

PLAYING THE GAME.

WINNETOU:

is SHOT IN THE BACK, before he even knows what is happening.

EDGAR WALLACE is SHOT by WICKI.

SGT. POLA NEGRI

FALLS to the floor in the confusion.

FEMALE SGT. BEETHOVEN and STIGLITZ bring their guns toward each other and FIRE. They BOTH TAKE and GIVE each other so many BULLETS it’s almost romantic when they collapse DEAD on the

floor.

WICKI and MATA HARI

both ON THEIR FEET, FIRING WILDLY at each other. MATA HARI is HIT THREE TIMES. WICKI is HIT ONCE.

SGT. POLA NEGRI

comes off the floor with a SUBMACHINE GUN and SPRAYS the

whole other side of the room, WIPING OUT WICKI, ERIC, MATA HARI, and THE BARMAID.

The SHOOTING STOPS . . . THE SMOKE caused by the gunfire . . .

starts to DISSIPATE . . . The only one in the room left alive is the

young German sergeant with the machine gun.

WE HEAR the feet of the soldiers outside reach the basement entrance.

The door opens . . .

The German sergeant sends FIFTY BULLETS in the door’s direction . . .

No one goes through it.

What we have here is a rabbit-hole-like situation. No one inside is getting out. No one outside is getting in.

The young German sergeant YELLS in ENGLISH to the outside:

GERMAN SERGEANT:

You outside! Who are you? British, American, what?

Aldo’s voice YELLS down the hole:

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

We’re Americans! What are you?

GERMAN SERGEANT:

I’m a German, you idiot!

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

You speak English pretty good for a German!

GERMAN SERGEANT:

I agree! So let’s talk!

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Okay, talk!

GERMAN SERGEANT:

I’m a father! My baby was born today

in Frankfurt! Five hours ago! His name is Max! We were in here drinking and celebrating! They’re the ones that

came in shooting and killing! It’s not my fault!

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Okay, okay, it wasn’t your fault!

What’s your name, soldier?

GERMAN SERGEANT:

Wilhelm!

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

That’s the same name as one of the guys you just killed!

WILHELM:

They attacked us!

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Okay, Wilhelm . . . is anybody alive on our side?

WILHELM:

No!

We hear a VOICE OFFSCREEN yell out:

BRIDGET’S VOICE (OS)

I’m alive!

Wilhelm spins in the direction of the voice.

On the floor, with a bullet in her BLOODY LEG, lies the still-alive Bridget von Hammersmark.

The German sergeant points the muzzle of the machine gun at the German celebrity, with hate in his eyes.

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Who’s that?

WILHELM:

(to BRIDGET,

low)

Make a sound, whore, and I spit!

Meaning the muzzle.

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Wilhelm, who is that?

WILHELM:

Is the girl on your side?

Pause.

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Which girl?

WILHELM:

Who do you think—von Hammersmark!

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Yeah, she’s ours!

WILHELM:

(to Bridget,

LOW, in GERMAN)

I thought so. So you run with the Americans now, huh? Now times are

bad?

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Is she okay?

WILHELM:

(to Bridget,

LOW, in GERMAN)

You despicable traitor.

(to Aldo)

She’s been shot, but she’s alive. (to Bridget,

LOW, in GERMAN)

For now.

We hear the Basterds curse their luck offscreen.

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Okay, Wilhelm, what’d ya say we make a deal?

WILHELM:

What’s your name?

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Aldo. Wilhelm, can I call ya Willi?

WILHELM:

Yes.

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

So, Willi, you know we could lob three or four or five or six grenades down there and your little war story ends here. But good fer you, bad fer her.

You die, she dies. So what say we make a swap?

WILLI:

Keep talking!

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Okay, Willi, here’s my deal! You let me and one of my men come down to take the girl away! And we take the girl and leave! That simple, Willi!

You go your way, we go ours! And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy! So what ‘ya say, Willi, we got a deal?

Willi thinks . . .

Bridget watches Willi think . . .

WILLI:

Aldo?

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

I’m here, Willi!

WILLI:

I want to trust you . . . But how can I?

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

What choice ya got?

WILLI:

I could kill the girl!

ALDO’S VOICE (OS)

Well, now, Willi, that’s true enough. But something you need to know, so

you don’t get the wrong idea. Ain’t none of us give a fuck ‘bout that girl. But, admittedly, if you kill

her, it would fuck up our plans. But you’ll be dead by then anyway, so

what’d you care? And let’s not forget that little Katzenjammer Max, growin’ up without a pop. So in the spirit of gettin’ you home to him, we got a deal, Willi?

WILLI:

Okay, Aldo. I’m going to trust you!

Come down, no guns!

Aldo and Hirschberg come down the stairs, showing open hands.

Willi keeps his machine gun trained on them.

Aldo, with his hands up, says:

ALDO:

Hey, Willi, what’s with the machine gun? I thought we had a deal.

WILLI:

We do have a deal. Now get the girl and go.

ALDO:

Not so fast, Willi. We only have a

deal, we trust each other. A Mexican standoff ain’t trust.

WILLI:

You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.

ALDO:

You got guns on us, you decide to

shoot, we’re dead. Up top, they got grenades, they drop ’em down here, you’re dead. That’s a Mexican

standoff, and that wasn’t the deal.

WILLI:

Just take that fuckin’ traitor and go! See? Now you’re down here— Now you get tricky—!

ALDO:

—No tricks!—Ain’t nobody gittin’ tricky, Willi! I swear to god, I’m too damn dumb to get tricky. But

(meaning

Hirschberg)

him and I lived up to the deal. We came down without guns. Now it’s your turn. No trust, no deal.

Willi pointing the gun at them . . . thinking . . .

ALDO:

I know you’re scared. I’m scared, he’s scared, we’re all scared.

So what’s it gonna be, Willi? Either we got a deal or you might as well just shoot us now.

Willi decides . . .

He puts the machine gun down on the bar.

WILLI:

Fine. Take that fucking traitor and get her out of my sight.

ALDO:

Danke, Willi, danke. Okay, Hirschberg, you grab her shoulder—

WHEN . . .

From behind Aldo and Hirschberg, Bridget lifts up Major Hellstrom’s WALTER and EMPTIES the remaining bullets into

Sgt. Willi, who FALLS to the floor, DEAD.

Aldo and Hirschberg spin around, shocked.

From the floor, the bloody, sweaty, and in excruciating pain (she’ll probably lose that leg} German movie star says to the two American soldiers she’s just meeting for the first time:

BRIDGET:

He was an enemy soldier who knew who

I was. He couldn’t live.

INT—FRENCH HOUSE IN COUNTRY (BEDROOM)—NIGHT

An OLD MAN lies asleep under the covers of his blankets, in his bed, in his bedroom . . .

WHEN . . .

. . . .

OFF SCREEN the

sound of a DOOR BEING KICKED OPEN . . .

. . . .

. The

SOUND of

what sounds like EIGHT

DOGS BARKING . . .

and the

sound

of FEET RUNNING TOWARD US . . .

his bedroom door is THROWN OPEN, and Sgt. Donowitz RUSHES IN, grabbing the old man in his bed and putting a

.45 automatic to his head.

SGT. DONOWITZ

(ENGLISH)

Doctor? Doctor?

OLD MAN:

(FRENCH)

What? What’s happening?

Donny SLAMS the .45 hard against the old man’s head, shocking, scaring, and bringing the old gent to attention.

SGT. DONOWITZ

(ENGLISH)

Doctor? Are you a fucking doctor?

He nods his head, yes.

SGT. DONOWITZ

Andiamo . . .

Donny YANKS/DRAGS the old man out of bed, in his almost comical nightshirt (which makes him cuter, thus the brutality against him hurts more) toward the door . . .

INT—DOCTOR’S EXAMINING ROOM—NIGHT

. . . Into a doctor’s examining room built into a French country house, with an examining table and medical instruments.

However, it’s obviously the medical examining room of a veterinarian.

Along the walls are different cages with eight BARKING dogs in them.

The soldiers are putting the shot-in-the-leg, bleeding, and in excruciating pain Bridget on the examining table.

Donny, still holding onto the Old Man, points in the girl’s direction . . .

SGT. DONOWITZ

(ENGLISH)

She’s been shot. Shot. Bang, bang . . .

(pointing at

his leg)

. . . in leg . . . understand?

OLD MAN:

(FRENCH)

No, no, no, I don’t speak English.

Donny jams the barrel of his .45 into the thigh of the old man.

SGT. DONOWITZ

(ENGLISH)

BANG, BANG—in the leg, understand!

The old man nods his head, yes.

OLD MAN:

(FRENCH)

But I’m a veterinarian . . . animals . . .

I take care of animals . . .

Bridget screams from the table . . .

BRIDGET:

(ENGLISH)

He’s a fucking veterinarian, you imbecile!

SGT. DONOWITZ

He’s still a doctor. If he can get a bullet out of a cow, he can get a bullet outta you.

LT. ALDO

Right now, we just need morphine.

Donny yells at the old man:

SGT. DONOWITZ

Morphine! We need morphine!

The old man tries to explain in French that he’s not a human doctor

. . .

Donny takes the .45 and SHOOTS one of the DOGS in the cages.

Everybody jumps.

Donny SCREAMS at the old man:

SGT. DONOWITZ

MORPHINE!

BANG:

He SHOOTS another dog . . .

SGT. DONOWITZ

MORPHINE!

The old man begs him to stop and goes to get the morphine.

CUT TO:

The BODY of Gestapo Major DIETER HELLSTROM dead on the floor.

INT—LA LOUISIANE—NIGHT

We’re back in the basement tavern. Col. Hans Landa stands

over the corpse. He moves over to the next corpse, and a smile breaks out on his face.

He says in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA

Ahhh, Hugo, you’ve moved up in the world, I see. Lieutenant. And with

your record of insubordination. Truly remarkable.

A Nazi soldier named HERRMAN joins the S.S. officer.

COL. LANDA

And that one’s . . .

(pointing at

Wicki)

. . . name is Wilhelm Wicki. He’s an Austrian- born Jew who immigrated

to the United States when things

began turning sour for the Israelites. They are the two German-born members of the Basterds. They’ve been known

to don German uniforms to ambush squads.

FLASH ON:

three Nazi soldiers walking toward a company of other German soldiers. The three soldiers’ back are to us. Dried, bloody bullet holes cover the backs of the three uniforms.

The SERGEANT of the German company yells to the trio:

SGT. GERMAN COMPANY

What brings you all the way out here?

The TRIO NOW DOWN the GERMAN COMPANY with their machine guns.

BACK TO LANDA:

COL. LANDA

But that doesn’t look like this.

This is odd.

Looking down he sees something . . .

Bending down, he examines Fräulein von Hammersmark’s two pretty dress shoes lying on the floor.

One shoe is covered in blood.

The other, while blood-speckled, is fairly clean.

Picking up the clean shoe and holding it in his hand.

COL. LANDA

It would appear somebody’s missing. Somebody fashionable.

AN OFFSCREEN SOLDIER’S VOICE cries out:

SOLDIERS VOICE (OS)

Colonel, this one’s still alive!

We follow Hans to the spot on the floor where Sgt. Willi lies. He’s shot in the chest, but it looks like Max’s daddy is still alive.

INT—EXAMINING ROOM—NIGHT

Bridget on the examining table, post morphine shot.

The other Basterds in the room watch Aldo interrogate the German lady.

LT. ALDO

Now ’fore we yank that slug outta ya, you need to answer a few questions.

BRIDGET:

Few questions about what?

LT. ALDO

About I got three men dead back there, and why don’t you try tellin’ us what the fuck happened?

BRIDGET:

The British officer blew his German act, and a Gestapo major saw it.

LT. ALDO

’Fore we get into who shot John, Why did you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?

BRIDGET:

I can see, since you didn’t see what happened inside, the Nazis being there must look odd.

LT. ALDO

Yeah, we gotta word for that kinda odd in English. It’s called suspicious.

BRIDGET:

Don’t let your imagination get the better of you, Lieutenant. You met

the sergeant, Willi. He had a baby tonight. His commanding officer gave

him and his friends the night off to celebrate. The Germans being there

was just a tragic coincidence.

Aldo thinks for a moment . . .

LT. ALDO

Okay, I’ll buy that. He was either there with his men waiting for us, or he was there celebrating his son’s birthday. He wasn’t doin’ both.

LT. ALDO

How did the shootin’ start?

BRIDGET:

The English man gave himself away.

LT. ALDO

How did he do that?

BRIDGET:

He ordered three glasses.

She holds up three fingers, middle to pinky.

BRIDGET:

He ordered three glasses.

She holds up three fingers, thumb to middle.

BRIDGET:

This is the German three. The other

is odd. Germans would and did notice it.

LT. ALDO

Okay, let’s pretend there were no Germans, and everything went exactly

the way it was supposed to. What would of been the next step?

BRIDGET:

Tuxedoes. To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms, with all the military there, would have been suicide. But going as members of the German film industry,

they wear tuxedoes and blend in with everybody else. I arranged a tailor

to fit three tuxedoes tonight.

LT. ALDO

How did you intend to get them into the premiere?

BRIDGET:

Hand me my purse.

They do. And she opens it and takes out three tickets to the film premiere.

BRIDGET:

Lt. Hicox was going as my escort.

The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.

LT. ALDO

Can you still get us into that premiere?

BRIDGET:

Can you speak German better than your friends? No. Have I been shot? Yes.

I don’t see me tripping the light fantastic up the red carpet anytime

soon. Least of all by tomorrow night.

(pause)

However, there’s something you don’t know. There’s been two recent developments regarding Operation

Kino. One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.

LT. ALDO

Enormous changes at the last minute? That’s not very Germanic. Why the

hell is Goebbels doin’ stuff so damn peculiar?

BRIDGET:

It probably has something to do with the second development.

LT. ALDO

Which is?

FLASH ON:

IN A PRIVATE DINING ROOM IN GERMANY, the FUHRER, aka Adolf Hitler, aka Adolf Shicklegroover, aka the Bohemian Corporal, having dinner with Goebbels, only a few short days ago.

THE FUHRER:

(GERMAN)

I’ve been rethinking my position in regards to your Paris premiere of “Nation’s Pride.” As the weeks have

gone on and the Americans are on

the beach, I do find myself thinking more and more about this Private

Zoller. This boy has done something tremendous for us. And I’m beginning

to think my participation in this event could be meaningful.

BACK TO BRIDGET:

BRIDGET:

The Führer’s attending the premiere.

Donny breaks the team’s silence:

SGT. DONOWITZ

What?

LT. ALDO

When the hell did this happen?

BRIDGET:

The venue change, two weeks ago. The Führer’s attendance, four days ago.

LT. ALDO

And how come London don’t know nothing about that?

BRIDGET:

We need to get something straight,

once and for all. Everything London knows, it learned from me. If I

don’t know, London doesn’t know.

So now, this is me, informing you, Hitler’s coming to Paris.

SGT. DONOWITZ

FUCK A DUCK!

Aldo stands up from the chair, pacing as he takes in this new information.

BRIDGET:

What are you thinking?

LT. ALDO

I’m thinking getting a wack at plantin’ ole Uncle Adolph makes this a horse of a different color.

BRIDGET:

What’s that supposed to mean?

LT. ALDO

It means you’re gettin’ us into that premiere.

BRIDGET:

I’m going to probably end up losing this leg, bye bye, acting career, fun while it lasted. How do you expect me to walk up a red carpet?

LT. ALDO

The doggie

doc’s gonna dig that slug outta your

gam. Then he’s gonna

wrap

it up

in a

cast, and

you gotta good

“how I broke my leg

mountain climbing” story.

That’s German, ain’t

it?

Y’all

like

climbin’

mountains,

don’t

cha?

BRIDGET:

I don’t. I like smoking, drinking, and ordering in restaurants, but I see your point.

LT. ALDO

We fill ya up with morphine, till it’s comin out ya ears. Then just limp your little ass up that rouge car-pet.

BRIDGET:

Splendid. When the Nazis put me up against a wall, it won’t hurt

so much.

(changing tone) I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?

HIRSCHBERG:

Other than Yiddish?

BRIDGET:

Preferably.

Donny, referring to Aldo and himself:

SGT. DONOWITZ

We both speak a little Italian.

BRIDGET:

With an atrocious accent, no doubt. But that doesn’t exactly kill us in the crib. Germans don’t have a

good ear for Italian. So you mumble Italian and brazen through it, is

that the plan?

LT. ALDO

That’s about it.

BRIDGET:

That sounds good.

LT. ALDO

It sounds like shit, but what else we gonna do, go home?

BRIDGET:

No, it’s good. If you don’t blow it

with that, I can get you in the building. (changes tone)

So, who does what?

LT. ALDO

Well, I speak the most Italian, so I’ll be your escort. Donowitz speaks

the second most, so he’ll be your Italian cameraman. And Hirschberg

third most, so he’ll be Donny’s assistant.

HIRSCHBERG:

I don’t speak Italian.

LT. ALDO

Like I said, third best. Just keep

your fuckin’ mouth shut. In fact, why don’t you start practicing right now.

BRIDGET:

(meaning Utivich)

What about the little one?

UTIVICH:

Do you mean me?

BRIDGET:

I didn’t mean any offense.

UTIVICH:

None taken, you German cunt.

LT. ALDO

Utivich is the chauffeur.

UTIVICH:

I can’t drive.

Bridget SCREAMS in frustration:

BRIDGET:

You Americans are fucking useless!

UTIVICH:

Gimmie a break. I’m from Manhattan.

LT. ALDO

No worries, son. We got over fourteen hours before the movie tomorrow.

More than enough time for you to learn to drive.

UTIVICH:

No, no, no, no, Lieutenant, it’s not!

LT. ALDO

Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, Private, it is. And yes, yes, yes, you will.

(changes tone)

Look, Utivich, you and I both know, if we went to grade school together,

you damn sure ain’t copyin’ off of my test. Well, I lernt to drive in four hours on a Tennessee mountain road.

And I’m a shit-for-brains coal miner bootlegger. Hirschberg, you know how to drive, right?

HIRSCHBERG:

Yes.

LT. ALDO

Teach ’im.

BRIDGET:

But there is a problem. I’m a movie star. This is a movie premiere.

I can’t show up looking like I was just in a Nazi gunfight. Now I

have a dress for the premiere at my hotel. But sometime tomorrow I

have to get my hair done.

All the Basterds, except Donny, burst out laughing.

LT. ALDO

Sister, you must got wunderbar luck. Guess who went to beauty school?

The CAMERA WHIP-PANS to SGT. DONOWITZ.

Bridget rolls her eyes.

BLACK FRAME:

CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:

CHAPTER FIVE:

“REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE”

FADE OFF:

INT—SHOSANNA AND MARCEL’S LIVING QUARTERS—NIGHT

We’re in Shosanna and Marcel’s living quarters above the cinema. We’ve never been in here before.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS ONSCREEN:

“NIGHT OF ‘NATION’S PRIDE’ PREMIERE”

Shosanna’s standing before a full-length mirror in a real attractive forties-style dress for the premiere. She’s stunning. This is the first time in her life she’s had the opportunity

or the occasion to wear something like this. Since she knows this is the last night of her life, no time like the present.

SOUNDS of the hubbub of the premiere, not to mention the

German brass band that’s blaring Third Reich marches, can be heard coming from below.

Shosanna walks to her apartment window and looks down at the Germanic miasma below.

SHOSANNA’S POV

WE SEE all the pageantry below. Tons of SPECTATORS. Tons of guests dressed in Nazi uniforms, tuxedoes, and female finery, walking up the long red carpet (with a big swastika in the middle, naturally) leading into Shosanna’s cinema. The German brass band omm-pa-pa-ing away. German radio and film crews covering the event for the fatherland back home. And, of course, MANY GERMAN SOLDIERS providing security for this joyous Germanic occasion.

Shosanna COUGHS up a lugi and HOCKS it.

A GERMAN S.S. GENERAL being interviewed by a RADIO COMMENTATOR—the lugi HITS him right on his bald head.

Shosanna goes back to the full-length mirror, places a very fashionable forties-style hat on her head, then lowers the period- style black fishnet veil over her face. She takes out

a small GUN and puts it in the pocket of her dress, and it’s on. She exits the apartment door to join the premiere.

From this point on, there’s no turning back. It’s all the way baby, all the fucking way!

INT—CINEMA STAIRWELL—NIGHT

The stairwell in the building that connects the living

quarters with the cinema. Shosanna walks down the stairs and goes through a door that puts her next to the projection booth door. She takes out a key and opens it.

INT—PROJECTION BOOTH—NIGHT

Marcel’s prepping the film reels for tonight. The five silver metal film cans that carry one 35mm reel of film each are laid out. The cans for reels one and two are empty. Cans for reel three, our specially marked can for reel four, and the can for reel five (which should never see the light of a projector) lie in wait.

Shosanna, looking like a forties movie star, enters the projection booth.

The scene in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

MARCEL:

Ooh la la, Danielle Darrieux, this is so exciting. Pleased to meet you.

SHOSANNA:

Shut up, fool.

Marcel lifts up the veil covering her face and their lips meet.

SHOSANNA:

Cheeky black bugger. I have to go down and socialize with these Hun pigs. Let’s go over it again?

MARCEL:

Reel one is on the first projector. Reel two is on the second. Three and four are ready to go.

SHOSANNA:

Okay, the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel. Our film comes on in the fourth reel, so somewhere toward the end of the third reel,

go down and lock the doors of the auditorium. Then take your place

behind the screen, and wait for my

CUE when I give it to you: BURN IT DOWN!

INT—CINEMA LOBBY—NIGHT

The pageantry of the evening is in full swing, as all the German beautiful people enter the cinema. They mingle in the swastika-covered, Greek-nude-statue-peppered lobby. Nazi military commanders, high-ranking party officials, and German celebrities (Emil Jannings, Veit Harlan) hobnob and drink Champagne from passing WAITERS, who carry glasses on silver trays.

We see Shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby parlor entrance. She descends the staircase and busies herself with theater stuff.

At the top of the staircase, looking down at the master race in all their finery, is Col. Hans Landa, dressed in his finest S.S. dress uniform.

CAMERA FRAME:

directly behind him. On the right side, we see the figure of Col. Landa, from behind, watching the guests entering the cinema. On the left side of the frame is the cinema entrance, from

alooking-down perspective of the guests entering the building. THEN . . .

A THINK BUBBLE, like in a comic book, appears on the left

side of the frame, obscuring the cinema entrance. Inside Landa’s think bubble a little scene plays out.

THINK BUBBLE:

A hospital room filled with DOCTORS, NURSES, and a

PATIENT in a hospital bed. Then Col. Landa enters the room and screams at everybody:

COL. LANDA

I want everybody out of this room!

They start to leave.

COL. LANDA

That means now, goddamnit!

They RUSH OUT.

He walks over to the patient in the hospital bed. It’s none other than SGT. WILLI, and yes, he’s still alive.

Landa pulls up a chair next to the bed and sits down.

COL. LANDA

Can you speak, Sergeant?

SGT. WILLI

(weakly)

Yes, Colonel.

COL. LANDA

Tell me everything that happened in there.

The THINK BUBBLE DISSOLVES away, revealing the entrance again, and as if on perfect cue, in walks Bridget von Hammersmark, dressed lovely, leg in a big white cast. The three Basterds in their tuxedos flank her.

CU COL. LANDA smiles.

He descends the stairs, toward the four saboteurs . . .

They speak in GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA

Fräulein von Hammersmark, what

has befallen Germany’s most elegant swan?

BRIDGET:

Col. Landa, it’s been years.

Dashing as ever, I see.

COL. LANDA

Flattery will get you everywhere, Fräulein.

They chuckle and air kiss.

COL. LANDA

So what’s happened to your lovely leg? A by-product of kicking ass in the German cinema, no doubt.

BRIDGET:

Save your flattery, you old dog. I know too many of your former conquests to fall into that honeypot.

Chuckle . . . chuckle . . .

COL. LANDA

Seriously, what happened?

BRIDGET:

Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I might add, at mountain climbing. And this was the result.

COL. LANDA

Mountain climbing? That’s how you injured your leg—mountain climbing?

BRIDGET:

Believe it or not, yes, it is.

A brief moment passes between the two . . .

THEN . . .

The colonel BURSTS OUT with UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. So uproarious, in fact, that it’s quite disconcerting to the four saboteurs.

The colonel begins to regain his composure . . .

COL. LANDA

Forgive me, Fräulein. I don’t mean to laugh at your misfortune. It’s just

. . . mountain climbing? I’m curious, Fräulein, what could have ever

compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor?

The double meaning is not lost on the German actress.

BRIDGET:

Well, I shan’t be doing it again, I can tell you that.

COL. LANDA

That cast looks as fresh as my old

Uncle Gustave. When were you climbing this mountain, last night?

BRIDGET:

Very good eye, Colonel. It happened yesterday morning.

COL. LANDA

Hummm. And where exactly in Paris is this mountain?

This stops her for a second.

Then Landa laughs it off, taking them off the hook.

COL. LANDA

I’m just teasing you, Fräulein. You know me, I tease rough. So who are your three handsome escorts?

BRIDGET:

I’m afraid neither of the three speak a word of German. They’re friends of

mine from Italy. This is a wonderful Italian stuntman, Antonio Margheriti.

(meaning Aldo)

A very talented cameraman, Enzo Gorlomi. (meaning Donny)

And Enzo’s camera assistant, Dominick Decocco.

The German Fräulein turns to the three tuxedo-wearing Basterds.

BRIDGET:

(ITALIAN)

Gentlemen, this is an old friend, Colonel Hans Landa of the S.S.

The Basterds know only too well who Landa the Jew Hunter is, but they can’t show it.

Aldo sticks out his hand . . .

LT. ALDO

Buongiorno.

The German takes his hand . . .

COL. LANDA

Margheriti . . .

(ITALIAN)

Am I saying it correctly? . . . Margheriti?

LT. ALDO

(ITALIAN)

Yes. Correct.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)

Margheriti . . . Say it for me once, please . .

. ?

LT. ALDO

Margheriti.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)

I’m sorry, again . . . ?

LT. ALDO

Margheriti.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)

Once more . . .?

LT. ALDO

Margheriti.

COL. LANDA

Margheriti.

(FRENCH) It means daisies, I believe.

Turning his gaze to Donny.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)

What’s your name again?

SGT. DONOWITZ

Enzo Gorlomi.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)

Again . . . ?

SGT. DONOWITZ

Gorlomi.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)

One more time, but let me really hear the music in it.

SGT. DONOWITZ

(HAMMY ITALIAN)

Gorlomi.

Now to Hirschberg . . .

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)

And you?

Then Hirschberg breaks out the best Italian accent of the group:

HIRSCHBERG:

Dominick Decocco.

COL. LANDA

Dominick Decocco?

HIRSCHBERG:

Dominic Decocco.

COL. LANDA

Bravo . . . Bravo.

BRIDGET:

(GERMAN)

Well, my two cameraman friends need to find their seats.

Col. Landa stops a WAITER with a tray of champagne glasses.

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN)

Not so fast. Let’s enjoy some champagne.

Everyone gets a glass.

COL. LANDA

(FRENCH)

—Oh, Mademoiselle Mimieux, please join us. I have some friends I’d like you to meet.

Shosanna joins the circle and is handed a champagne glass.

This is the first moment the Basterds are aware of Shosanna.

COL. LANDA

(FRENCH)

May I say, Mademoiselle, you look divine.

SHOSANNA (FRENCH)

Merci.

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN)

This lovely young lady is Mademoiselle Emmanuelle Mimieux. This is her cinema, and she is our hostess for the evening.

(FRENCH)

And, Mademoiselle, this battered, broken, and none-worse-for-the-wear German goddess, is Bridget von Hammersmark.

BRIDGET:

Bonjour.

SHOSANNA:

Bonjour.

BRIDGET:

(FRENCH)

I’m afraid my companions don’t speak

any French. They’re Italian. This is Antonio, Enzo, and Dominick.

All three smile goofy, spaghetti-bender smiles.

COL. LANDA

(FRENCH)

Actually, Fräulein von Hammersmark’s Italian associates need help finding their seats. Perhaps Mademoiselle Mimieux would be so kind as to escort them?

SHOSANNA (FRENCH)

It would be my pleasure. Let me see your tickets?

Donny hands her two tickets. She indicates for them to follow her.

Donny and Hirschberg both exchange one last look with Aldo, then follow the young French girl into the auditorium.

INT—AUDITORIUM—NIGHT

The cinema auditorium is filling up quickly with gray and black uniforms.

Shosanna finds the two counterfeit Italians their seats.

After she points out their seats, she turns to leave . . .

Hirschberg . . .

reaches out and grabs her wrist. . . .

He looks her in the face and, filled with tremendous guilt, because if he’s successful tonight he’s going to blow this

cute French girl to smithereens, he says:

HIRSCHBERG:

Grazie.

The cute French girl looks back at the goofy-looking Italian boy with slicked-back hair that makes him look kind of

Jewish with tremendous guilt, knowing if she is successful tonight, she’s going to burn him alive, and says:

SHOSANNA:

Prego.

BACK TO THE LOBBY

They begin flicking the lights on and off. A GERMAN SOLDIER YELLS IN GERMAN:

GERMAN SOLDIER:

Take your seats! The show is about to begin!

Everybody take your seats!

Col. Landa, Lt. Aldo, and Bridget are still together.

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN)

I must call the Führer. He doesn’t

want to make his entrance until everybody is seated. Come with me, Frau von Hammersmark. The Führer has

heard you’re here, and he wishes to commend you personally.

BRIDGET:

(GERMAN)

Me? Why?

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN)

Don’t be modest. Everybody is quite taken with your resolve. An accident like you’ve just experienced, and

yet you still show up to an important party event. The Führer

was quite adamant in his gratitude. We’ll use Mademoiselle Mimieux’s office.

(to Aldo

in Italian)

I’m afraid I must rob you of your companion, but only for a moment.

BRIDGET:

(ITALIAN)

Yes, apparently the Führer wishes to commend me.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)

Wait here a moment. I promise I won’t detain her long.

What are either of them supposed to do, argue?

Col. Landa goes over to one of the Nazi GUARDS/USHERS and whispers in his ear, guesturing toward Aldo. Like he’s saying, leave the boy alone, till we come back . . . Or is he?

Col. Landa limps Bridget away toward Shosanna’s office.

As Aldo stands in the lobby, more and more people enter the auditorium, till it’s only Aldo and the six Nazi guards/ushers in the now-vacant lobby.

INT—SHOSANNA’S OFFICE—NIGHT

Shosanna’s cinema manager’s office. It’s small, cluttered, and dominated by a desk.

They both enter.

Col. Landa closes the door behind him and LOCKS IT.

Bridget notices but says nothing.

Now the two Germans are alone.

COL. LANDA

Have a seat, Fräulein.

Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk.

She lowers herself in the chair.

Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk,

opposite her, the S.S. Colonel pulls another little chair over and places it in front of the fräulein.

He sits, their knees almost touching.

The colonel points to the foot not in the cast.

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN)

Let me see your foot.

BRIDGET:

(GERMAN)

I beg your pardon?

Patting his lap.

COL. LANDA

Put your foot in my lap.

BRIDGET:

Colonel, you embarrass me.

COL. LANDA

I assure you, Fräulein, my intention is not to flirt.

Patting his lap more with more aggression.

The nervous fräulein lifts up her strappy dress shoe enclosed foot and places it in the colonel’s lap.

The Colonel very delicately unfastens the thin straps that hold the fräulein’s shoe on her foot . . .

. . . . He removes the shoe . . .

. . . . Leaving only the fräulein’s bare foot . . .

THEN . . .

He removes from his heavy S.S. coat pocket the pretty dress shoe the fräulein left behind at La Louisiane . . .

He slips it on her foot . . .

. . . . It fits like a glove.

Bridget knows she’s BUSTED.

Col. Landa smiles and says in ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA

What’s that American expression . . .

“If the shoe fits . . . you must wear it.”

He removes her foot from his lap.

BRIDGET:

(GERMAN)

What now, Colonel?

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN) Do you admit your treachery?

She stares defiant daggers into him.

BRIDGET:

(GERMAN)

The only think I will admit to is resisting you

. . .

(ENGLISH)

Sons-a-bitches . . .

(GERMAN)

. . . to my last breath.

COL. LANDA “Resist to your last breath”?

SUDDENLY . . .

Hans LUNGES forward, putting his strong mitts around Bridget von Hammersmark’s lily-white, delicate neck, and with all the violence of a lion in mid-pounce, SQUEEZES with all his MIGHT.

Bridget’s face turns tomato RED, as the VEINS in her face BULGE and her esophagus is CRUSHED in his GRIP.

With a violent YANK, he JERKS her TO THE FLOOR. She TUMBLES

out of the chair, Landa never releasing his GRIP around her throat. Now fully on top of her, he BEARS DOWN, SQUEEZING THE VERY LIFE OUT OF HER. Everything he has, he brings to bear on

the elegant lady’s neck.

Then, to finally finish her off, he begins BANGING THE BACK OF HER HEAD, HARD AGAINST THE FLOOR . . .

BANG!

BANG!

BANG!

She’s dead.

He releases the grip around her throat. His hands are TREMBLING . . .

He rises.

Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bare hands is the most violent act a human being can commit.

Also, only humans strangle, opposable thumbs being a quite important part of the endeavor. As Hans Landa stands, the sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task

still surges through him. He tries to gain control of the trembling that is rippling through his body. He takes out a silver S.S. FLASK (filled with peach schnapps) and knocks back

a couple of swigs. He holds his hand out in front of him. The TREMBLING is beginning to subside. He picks up the telephone.

Into the phone, in German, he says:

COL. LANDA

Inform the Führer the audience has taken their seats, and we’re ready to begin.

Step one in Hans’s master plan, done.

He then dials another number . . .

INT—LOBBY—NIGHT

Aldo in the lobby . . .

WHEN . . .

. . . . He’s JUMPED by the SIX NAZI USHERS . . .

He’s THROWN

ROUGHLY:

to the

ground face

first.

Like the modern-

day

Secret Service,

within

seconds his

wrists

are handcuffed behind

his

back and he’s

searched. They

find the BOMB attached to his

ankle. It’s

removed, and

a

BLACK:

CLOTH:

BAG:

is

pulled over his head.

Then he’s hoisted

up and

RUSHED out of

the

building.

This happens in mere seconds, and quietly too. No one in the auditorium is none the wiser . . .

INT—AUDITORIUM—NIGHT

. . . including Donowitz and Hirschberg, sitting among the master race, waiting for showtime.

EXT—CINEMA—NIGHT

The six Nazi soldiers hustle the hooded Aldo down the red carpet, then into the alley beside the cinema.

Aldo’s put up against a wall.

Inside the black hood, he’s SCREAMING every insulting thing about Germany, Germans, German food, German

shepherd . . . anything.

COL. LANDA’S VOICE (OS)

Shut up!

The faceless black hood does.

Col. Landa, now standing directly in front of his hooded prisoner, says in ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA

As Stanley said to Livingstone: Lieutenant Aldo

Raine, I presume?

LT. ALDO

Hans Landa?

COL. LANDA

You’ve had a nice long run, Aldo.

Alas, you’re now in the hands of the S.S. My hands to be exact. And they’ve been waiting a long time to touch you.

He reaches out with his finger and lightly touches Aldo’s face right in the middle of the hood.

Aldo’s head VIOLENTLY FLINCHES.

COL. LANDA

Caught ya flinching.

In German, he orders the men to put Aldo in the back of a truck.

Aldo, bound and bagged, is put in the truck. Also in the truck is Utivich, wearing a makeshift chauffeur’s uniform, bound and bagged like the lieutenant.

The truck drives off.

Col. Landa turns around and SEES FROM A DISTANCE Hitler’s motorcade pull up to the cinema. Then the Führer, Goebbels, Francesca, and the rest of the entourage make their way down

the red carpet into the cinema.

Landa smiles.

EXT TRUCK (MOVING)—NIGHT

We see the truck leaving the city of Paris, under the veil of night.

We also seem to be leaving the drama of Operation Kino.

INT—TRUCK (MOVING)—NIGHT

The two hooded prisoners bounce along in the back of the truck.

Utivich is crying inside his hood.

LT. ALDO

Utivich?

UTIVICH:

Is that you, Lieutenant?

LT. ALDO

Yep.

UTIVICH:

Do you know what happened to Donny? Hirschberg?

The woman?

UTIVICH:

Do you know what happened to Donny? Hirschberg? The woman?

LT. ALDO

No, I do not.

UTIVICH:

Lieutenant, sorry I’m crying.

LT. ALDO

Nothin’ to be sorry about, son.

This bag get to anyone.

UTIVICH:

Not exactly John Wayne, am I?

LT. ALDO

John Wayne’s a pampered movie star. He bursts into tears if his cook busts his yoke at breakfast. Just try puttin’ a bag over his head and hear what kinda sounds he makes.

Utivich giggles through the tears.

LT. ALDO

I just want you to know, son, I was real proud of you tonight. Learnin’ how to drive overnight. Driving in that limo line. You was in the hot seat, son, and you stood up real good.

Utivich cries LOUDER.

Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivich’s foot, and places his foot on top.

The TOUCH has a slightly calming effect on Utivich.

In the darkness, Utivich has reclaimed his dignity.

EXT—COUNTRY TAVERN—NIGHT

The truck pulls up to a small tavern outside of Paris (not La Louisaiane).

The two hooded prisoners are walked inside the establishment.

INT—COUNTRY TAVERN—NIGHT

The hooded men are led into the closed for business, but open for something else rustic tavern.

The Nazi guards unlock the handcuffs, then sit them down in chairs.

Then, simultaneously, the hoods are YANKED OFF.

The two prisoners are seated at a table, in what they can now see is a rustic tavern. On the table is one telephone, one bottle of Chianti, and three glasses. And on the opposite end of the table sits Col. Hans Landa.

ANAZI SOLDIER sits posted at an impressive-looking two-way radio set up in the tavern.

Col. Landa starts in right away at the two baffled, discombobulated American soldiers.

They will only speak ENGLISH in the scene.

COL. LANDA

Italian? Really?

(BEAT)

What could you have possibly been thinking?

LT. ALDO

Well, I speak a little Italian—

COL. LANDA

I speak a little Tagalog, but I wouldn’t begin to presume I could pass for Filipino. Don’t get me

wrong, I understand you were in a pickle, what with you losing your Germans. And I have nothing but admiration for improvisation. Still . . . Chico Marx is more

convincing. If the three of you had shown up at the premiere dressed

in woman’s attire, it would have been more convincing.

Landa’s eyes go to the two Nazi guards behind the prisoners.

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN)

You may leave us. But stay alert outside.

They exit, leaving the colonel, the lieutenant, the private, and a German radio man in the corner.

COL. LANDA

So you’re Aldo the Apache?

LT. ALDO

So you’re the Jew Hunter?

COL. LANDA

Jew Hunter (pfuit). I’m a detective. A damn good detective. Finding people is my specialty. So naturally

I worked for the Nazis finding people. And yes, some of them were Jews.

But Jew Hunter? Just the name that stuck.

UTIVICH:

Well, you do hafta admit, it is catchy.

COL. LANDA

Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you? Aldo the

Apache and the Little Man?

UTIVICH:

What do you mean, the Little Man?

COL. LANDA

The German’s nickname for you.

UTIVICH:

The German’s nickname for me is the Little Man?

COL. LANDA

Or the “Little One”, either one means you. And as if to make my point, I’m a

little surprised how tall you

are in real life. I mean, you’re a little fellow. But not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.

LT. ALDO

Where are my men? Where is Bridget von Hammersmark?

COL. LANDA

Bridget von Hammersmark. Oh, I’m sure she’s in whatever, big bubbling

cesspool in hell the devil reserves for traitors of her ilk.

COL. LANDA

(CON’T)

Well, let’s just say she got what she deserved. And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.

Now as far as your paisanos

Sergeant Donowitz and Private Hirschberg—

LT. ALDO

How do you know our names?

COL. LANDA

Lt. Aldo, if you don’t think I wouldn’t interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors . . . ?

We simply aren’t operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed. Now, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs. At this moment, both Hirschberg

and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in. Seats

0023 and 0024, if my memory serves. Explosives, still around their ankles, still ready to explode.

And your mission, some

would call it a terrorist plot, as of this moment is still a go.

The two basterds don’t believe this. It can’t be true.

LT. ALDO

That’s a pretty exciting story.

What’s next, Eliza on the ice?

COL. LANDA

However, all I have to do is pick up that phone right there, inform the cinema, and your plans kaput.

LT. ALDO

IF they’re still there, and IF they’re still alive, and that’s one big IF, there ain’t no way you gonna take

them boys without settin’ off them bombs.

COL. LANDA

I have no doubt, and yes, some Germans will die, and yes, it will ruin the evening, and yes, Goebbels will be very very very mad at you

for what you’ve done to his big night. But you won’t get Hitler, you won’t

get Goebbels, you won’t get Goering, and you won’t get Boormann. And you need all four to end the war.

(pause)

But if I don’t pick up that phone right there, you may very well get all four. And if you get all four, you end the war . . . tonight.

The Nazi colonel lifts up the bottle of Chianti and fills three glasses. As he pours, he says:

COL. LANDA

So, gentlemen, let’s discuss the prospect of ending the war . . . tonight.

All three have their Chianti filled glasses.

COL. LANDA

So the way I see it, since Hitler’s death, or possible rescue, rests

solely on my reaction . . . If I do nothing . .

. It’s as if I’m causing his death, even more than yourselves.

Would you agree?

LT. ALDO

I guess so.

COL. LANDA

How about you, Utivich?

UTIVICH:

I guess so too.

COL. LANDA

Good, we more or less all agree. Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler, and killing Goebbels, and killing Goering, and killing Boormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies,

only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.

Now they get it.

COL. LANDA

If you want to win the war, tonight, we have to make a deal.

LT. ALDO

What kinda deal?

COL. LANDA

The kind you wouldn’t have the

authority to make. However, I’m sure this mission of yours has a

commanding officer? A general, I’m betting. For

. . .

(thinking)

. . . . O.S.S. would be my guess.

Aldo’s eyebrows reveal that was a good guess.

COL. LANDA

Oooh, that’s a bingo. Is that the way you say it, that’s a bingo?

LT. ALDO

You just say, bingo.

COL. LANDA

Bingo! How fun. But I digress, where

were we? Oh, yes, make a deal. Over there is a very capable two-way

radio. And sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Herrman. Get me somebody on

the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my—

let’s call it, the terms of my conditional surrender, if that tastes better going down.

BACK TO THE PREMIER

Shosanna is in the booth. She brings down the lights.

In the packed, excited auditorium, the house lights go down.

CU CURTAIN SWITCH. She flips it.

In the auditorium, the RED VELVET CURTAINS part.

Shosanna throws the lever on the first projector.

The PROJECTOR BULB goes HOT WHITE, PROJECTING A BEAM . . .

FILM REELS rotate . . .

35mm FILM moves through the projector’s film gate . . .

The opening seal of a film by the THIRD REICH flickers on the SCREEN . . .

Goebbels and Francesca watch . . .

Shosanna, in the booth, watches through the little window . . .

The CAMERA PANS OFF of Shosanna to the clearly marked film can, REEL 4. The SURPRISE REEL.

BACK TO LANDA AND THE BASTERDS

Landa, with radio headphones over his ears and a microphone

in his hand, talks to the UNSEEN/UNHEARD American brass on the other end.

COL. LANDA

. . . So, when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of

Operation Kino from the very beginning, as a double agent.

Anything I’ve done in my guise as an S.S. colonel was sanctioned by the O.S.S., as a necessary evil to

establish my cover with the Germans. And it was my placement of

Lieutenant Raine’s dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels’s opera box that assured their demise. By the way, that last

part is actually true.

FLASH ON:

Landa placing bomb in Hitler and Goebbels’s opera box.

BACK TO LANDA:

COL. LANDA

I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.

I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.

He looks over and sees Aldo and Utivich watching the one-sided conversation.

COL. LANDA

In fact, I want all the members of “Operation Kino” to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor. Full citizenship for myself—but that goes without saying. And I would

like the United States of America to purchase property for me on

Nantucket island, as a reward for all the countless lives I’ve saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter than imagined end. Do you have all that, sir?

(pause)

I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.

(pause)

He’s right here.

The colonel hands the headphones and microphone to Aldo.

LT. ALDO

Yes, sir?

We HEAR the VOICE on the other end of the radio give Aldo his orders:

RADIO VOICE (OS)

Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as

prisoners. Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck,

drive to our lines. Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you. You will

then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for

debriefing. Is that clear, Lieutenant?

LT. ALDO

Yes, sir.

The conversation is over. He puts the radio down.

The three men look at one another.

Landa picks up his wine.

COL. LANDA

So I suppose the only thing left to do is lift a glass and toast to Donowitz and Hirschberg’s success. You too, Herrman, come over here.

The four men, Col. Hans Landa, Lt. Aldo Raine, Pfc. Smithson Utivich, and Herrman, lift up four glasses of wine.

COL. LANDA

Gentlemen, to history, and its witnesses.

CHEERS.

BACK TO THE PREMIERE

WE CUT TO THE B/W FILM ON SCREEN.

Fredrick Zoller, playing himself, is in an ornamental tower in a Russian village, picking off RUSSIAN SOLDIERS below.

A RUSSIAN GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY

peering at the German private through binoculars. He lowers the long-range glasses and confers with one of his OFFICERS.

GEN. KCHOVLANSKEY

(RUSSIAN)

What’s the death toll?

OFFICER:

(RUSSIAN)

47, so far.

WE HEAR A SHOT.

OFFICER:

(RUSSIAN)

48.General, I implore you, we must destroy that tower!

GEN. KCHOVLANSKEY

(RUSSIAN)

That tower is one of the oldest and most beautiful structures in Russia.

I won’t be responsible for turning a thousand years of history into dust!

A BRAVE RUSSIAN SOLDIER tries to run between two buildings.

Zoller gets him.

Then proceeds to pick him apart, one bullet at a time.

SHOSANNA IN THE PROJECTION BOOTH

She removes “REEL 4” (the Special Shosanna Reel) and prepares

it on the second projector. Reel 3, on the first projector, playing now, is halfway through. In a few short minutes, it’s going to be show time.

Marcel says to Shosanna in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

MARCEL:

It’s time. I should go lock the auditorium and take my place behind the screen.

This is the last time they will ever see each other—too much to say. He holds her in his arms and lays a one kiss before I die wet one on her.

DONOWITZ AND HIRSCHBERG

sit in their seats watching the movie, surrounded by DRESS-UNIFORM NAZIS. They’ve developed a dopey way of communicating with each other in this hostile environment.

Basically, speaking English as if it were gibberish Italian they say English words, only adding an “I” or “A” or “O” to the end of it. And saying it in an exaggerated Italian accent, complete with pantomimes.

Donowitz leans into Hirschberg and says in a whisper:

They speak in ITALIAN-ISH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

SGT. DONOWITZ

(ITALIAN-ISH)

I-a go-a toilet-a, set-ta Boom-a.

(I go to the toilet and set the bomb.) When-a I-a go-a, you-a set-ta Boom-a. (When I go, you set your bomb.)

Hirschberg indicates/pantomimes that he can’t set his bomb surrounded by all these Nazis.

Donowitz pantomimes crossing his legs and setting the bomb on his ankle in his seat. Then getting up and dropping it in the back of the auditorium in the dark.

Hirschberg doesn’t get it.

HIRSCHBER:

What-a?

(What?)

Donny pantomimes again, more exaggerated, and with less patience.

HIRSCHBERG:

Affirm-ato, affirm-ato (Affirmative, affirmative.)

SGT. DONOWITZ

They-o look-o screen-a, not-o you-a. (They’re looking at the screen, not you.)

HIRSCHBERG:

Fantastic-o. (Fantastic.)

SGT. DONOWITZ

After-teri, set-ta, five-o moment-o (pointing to

watch)

You-a, pphisst.

(After you set the bomb, wait five minutes, and get out of here.)

HIRSCHBERG:

What-o? (What?)

SGT. DONOWITZ

Confussi-i, confuss-i, confuss-i. (Confused, confused, confused.) What-a, and-o what-o, same-o?

(I thought “What-a” meant “What.” Does “What-o” mean “What,” as well?)

HIRSCHBERG:

Oh-o, sorr-o, I-o meant-a “What-a.” (Oh, sorry, I meant what.)

SGT. DONOWITZ After-teri, you-a set-ta bom-a, five-o moment-o, you-a, fuck-o pphisst.

(After you set the bomb, wait five minutes and get the fuck out of here.)

HIRSCHBERG:

Affirm-ato, affirm-ato. (Affirmative, affirmative.)

SGT. DONOWITZ

Good-a, luck-a. (Good luck.)

Donowitz stands up from his seat and walks out of the dark auditorium into the lobby. The Nazi guards/ushers are gone, and the lobby is completely empty. Seeing the STAIRS leading down to the WATER CLOSET/BATHROOM, he descends them to plant the Boom-a—I mean, the bomb.

DESCENDING THE STAIRS

leading to the water closet. Like a lot of old cinemas, not only was the water closet located under the auditorium, you had to pass through a rather large SMOKING LOUNGE to get to it. In the smoking lounge are TEN NAZI ENLISTED MEN, the guards/ushers for the event, smoking and indulging in soldiers’ gossip. They’re all in dress uniforms, and all are armed.

Donowitz, in his tuxedo, acts cool and walks right through them.

They look up but don’t disturb their time-off vibe.

Donny enters the big water closet. Except for ONE LONE NAZI ENLISTED MAN at the urinal, it would appear as if

Donny has the whole washroom to himself.

He enters the privacy of a toilet stall and locks the door.

MARCEL IN LOBBY:

He descends the stairs leading down from the projection booth into the empty lobby. He goes to one of the auditorium doors

and peers inside.

WE SEE THE SCREEN AND THE AUDIENCE FROM MARCEL’S POV in the back of the room. The audience seems riveted to Fredrick’s exploits onscreen.

Marcel closes the door and, with a KEY, DEADBOLTS it SHUT.

INSIDE THE AUDITORIUM

WE PAN OFF THE SCREEN to Marcel, who locks the two doors on either side of the screen . . . Due to curtains placed there, no one notices Marcel’s actions.

Marcel then goes BEHIND THE SCREEN. WE SEE THE IMAGE

(backward) of Fredrick’s sniper battle HUGE, COVERING THE ENTIRE SIDE OF THE ROOM . . . A PILE of over 300 nitrate FILM PRINTS lies like a junk pile, right behind the screen.

Sitting down in a wooden chair facing the screen and pile-o-film, he lights up a cigarette, an absolute no-no in a cinema of this era, but tonight, what does it matter?

He smokes and waits for his cue to . . . BURN IT DOWN!

FREDRICK IN OPERA BOX

alongside Hitler, Goebbels, Francesca, and Boormann. Onscreen

the battle rages. He leans over and whispers something in Goebbel’s ear we can’t hear. Goebbels makes a very sympathetic face (at least sympathetic for Goebbels) and says in German:

GOEBBELS:

Perfectly understandable, dear boy. You go now, and we’ll see you after the show.

He exits the opera box and walks to the projection booth door. He raps on the door in a trying to be amusing way.

The door opens, just a little bit. Shosanna, not friendly, stares at him.

He, as usual, is all smiles and charm.

They speak in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

FREDRICK:

Are you the manager of this cinema? I want my money back. That actor in the movie stinks.

He laughs.

She doesn’t even smile. She says, all serious business:

SHOSANNA:

What are you doing here?

FREDRICK:

I came to visit you.

SHOSANNA:

Can’t you see how busy I am?

FREDRICK:

Then allow me to lend an assist.

SHOSANNA:

Fredrick, it’s not funny. You can’t be here. This is your premiere. You need to be out there with them.

As Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale with all the charm at his command, Shosanna listens, knowing the third reel is just about over and her big reel change is coming up.

FREDRICK:

Normally, you would be right.

And for all the other films I do, I intend to endure evenings like tonight in the proper spirit. However, the fact remains, this film is based on my military exploits. And in this case, my exploits

consisted of me killing many men. Consequently, the part of the film

that’s playing now, . . . I don’t like watching this part.

SHOSANNA:

Fredrick, I am sorry, but—

FREDRICK:

—So, I thought I’d come up here and do what I do best, annoy you. And from the look on your face, it would appear I haven’t lost my touch.

DONNY IN TOILET:

Sgt. Donowitz, with BOMB in his lap, sets the timer for six minutes from now. He then places the bomb in the back of the toilet tank.

CAMERA ON FLOOR OF WATER CLOSET

We see the tile of the floor stretch out before us. We see

Donny’s feet in the closed toilet stall. We HEAR the OFFSCREEN Nazi enlisted man finish his piss. Then HIS SHOES WALK

THROUGH FRAME . . . WE FOLLOW THEM TO . . . the SINK . . . WE STAY ON the shoes . . . as WE HEAR the Soldier WASH HIS HANDS . . . THEN

. . . THE CAMERA RISES UP HIS PANT LEG . . . till . . . WE’RE EYE LEVEL with the German soldier, with an ARMY CAP on his head, who’s done washing his hands . . . THEN . . . the soldier removes

his cap, brushes some bangs out of his face, and WE SEE

THE SWASTIKA HAND-CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD, THE UNDENIABLE MARK OF THE BASTERDS. He SPLASHES some WATER ON HIS FACE, puts his

cap back on his head, and joins his comrades in the smoking lounge. As he exits THE FRAME, he says to somebody OFFSCREEN;

SWASTIKA FOREHEAD

(GERMAN)

Hey, Fritz, you owe me three cigarettes. Now pay up.

SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK

Fredrick still outside the doorway, and Shosanna still baring the way.

SHOSANNA:

I have to get prepared for the reel change.

FREDRICK:

Let me do it?

SHOSANNA:

No.

FREDRICK:

Oh, please, it’s been two years since I’ve done a reel change.

SHOSANNA:

I said, no.

FREDRICK:

(cute whine)

Come on, it’s my premiere.

SHOSANNA:

Are you so used to the Nazis kissing your ass, you’ve forgotten what the

word “no” means? No, Fredrick, you can’t come in here. Now go away!

No subtitles for Fredrick needed this time. He gets it.

He does a one-armed PILE-DRIVE PUSH on the door, knocking both it OPEN and Shosanna back into the room.

Fredrick, a different cat than we’ve seen up till now, enters the booth, closing the door behind him and LOCKING it.

The quite startled Shosanna says to Fredrick:

SHOSANNA:

Fredrick, you hurt me.

FREDRICK:

Well, it’s nice to know you can feel something. Even if it’s just physical pain.

Fredrick steps forward . . .

Shosanna steps backward . . .

FREDRICK:

I’m not a man you say “Go away” to. There’s over three hundred dead bodies in Russia that, if they could, would testify to that.

After what I’ve done for you, you disrespect me at your peril.

BACK TO WASHROOM

The Swastika forehead soldier gets a light for his cigarette. He takes a big drag.

SOLDIER’S POV

He faces the washroom, and down that long row, he sees Donny emerge from the toilet stall. His tuxedo jacket is off and

draped over his right hand. Sporting the white dress shirt and black tuxedo vest, he’s quite far away, so now he just

looks like some guy in a tux who just finished taking a shit. Donny walks toward us . . .

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD

seeing him get closer . . .

SOLDIER POV:

Donny gets closer . . .

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD

seeing him closer still . . .

SOLDIER POV:

Donny gets closer . . .

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD begins to notice . . .

SOLDIER POV:

Donny getting closer, begins to notice the German soldier notice him . . .

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD

Now Donny is close enough for the soldier to recognize. His face SCREAMS:

SWASTIKA FOREHEAD

The Bear Jew!!!

The soldier’s GUN is out of its holster and rising toward Donny’s chest . . .

WHEN . . .

Donny raises his right arm, with the tuxedo jacket on it, and FIRES a GUN concealed under it.

HITTING Swastika Forehead in the chest . . . who finishes raising his GUN, FIRING, HITTING Donny in the chest . . .

The two soldiers FIRE INTO each other . . . till their weapons are empty, and the two men lie dead on the floor.

The ten other NAZIS in the room stand shocked at what just happened in front of them.

SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK IN THE PROJECTION ROOM

Fredrick hears the gunshots below them and turns toward the door.

FREDRICK:

What the hell was that?

While Fredrick’s back is turned, Shosanna takes a GUN out of her pocket and SHOOTS Fredrick THREE TIMES in the back . . .

. . . He CRASHES HARD into the door, then FALLS FACE FIRST to the floor . . .

Shosanna, gun in hand, looks out the projection booth window into the audience . . .

The ONSCREEN BATTLE rages so LOUDLY with GUNFIRE that her weapon didn’t stand a chance of being heard.

Her eyes go from the audience . . .

. . . up to the big screen . . .

. . . which holds FREDRICK ZOLLER in a tight, handsome CLOSEUP.

The face on the silver screen breaks the young girl’s heart . . .

. . . She looks to his body, lying face down on the floor, blood flowing from the holes she put in his back . . .

. . . His body moves a little, and he lets out a painful MOAN . . .

. . . DYING though he is, at this moment Fredrick is still ALIVE . . .

Shosanna moves to him . . .

. . . She touches him, and he lets out another MOAN . . .

. . . She turns his body over on its back . . .

. . . He’s holding a LUGER in his hand . . .

. . . He FIRES TWICE . . .

BANG BANG:

Two bullets HIT HER POINT BLANK IN THE CHEST . . .

THROWING HER against the wall, then FALLING FORWARD on her knees to the floor . . .

. . . Fredrick, Luger still in hand, takes aim from the floor . . .

. . . FIRES . . .

HITTING the bloody girl on the floor, in the thigh . . .

. . . SPINNING her BODY around in agony . . .

Like he did to the Russian onscreen, he picks her apart, one bullet at a time . . .

. . . FIRES . . .

A BULLET BLOWS OFF THE HEEL OF HER FOOT . . .

The Luger drops to floor. Fredrick DIES.

Our young French Jewish heroine lies on the projection booth floor in a pool of her own blood, her body RIDDLED with bullets, her nerve endings wracked with pain, CRIPPLED and DYING . . .

WHEN . . .

. . . The little bell on the 1st projector starts to ring, informing the projectionist it’s time for the REEL CHANGE.

Dying or not, if Shosanna intends to get her revenge, she’s going to have to lift her ass off the floor and execute this fucking reel change.

CINEMA AUDITORIUM

The battle onscreen continues. The audience is riveted.

The FUHRER

watches, completely caught up in the dramatic spectacle. He says to Goebbels in German:

HITLER:

Extraordinary, Joseph, simply extraordinary. This is your finest

film yet.

Goebbels is beyond proud. He smiles to Francesca, who proudly pats his hand.

PROJECTION BOOTH

Shosanna, bloody, crippled, and fucked, with great and painful effort, PULLS HERSELF OFF THE FLOOR . . .

AUDITORIUM:

Hirschberg, sitting in his seat, SETS the BOMB on his ankle, then stands up and begins scooting past everybody in his row’s knees.

PROJECTION BOOTH

Like the German heroine in one of Riefenstahl’s mountain films, Shosanna CLIMBS UP the 35mm film projector, like it was

Pitz Palu . . .

FILM ONSCREEN:

Private Zoller FIRING away from his perch. In the top far-

right corner of the FRAME, WE SEE the 1st REEL CHANGE MARK . . .

PROJECTION BOOTH

Shosanna hanging onto the projector, waiting for the 2nd reel change mark. It’s an agonizing effort . . .

BEHIND THE SCREEN

Marcel, smoking, waiting for his cue . . .

HIRSCHBERG:

gets out of his row and begins walking up the aisle in the middle of the cinema toward the exit.

ONSCREEN:

SERGIO LEONE CU FREDRICK. He SCREAMS to the Russians below:

MOVIE ZOLLER:

Who wants to send a message to

Germany?

In the top right of THE FRAME, the 2nd REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON . .

.

PROJECTION BOOTH

Shosanna TOSSES herself to the floor, as she THROWS THE CHANGE-OVER SWITCH on the 2nd projector . . .

EX CU PROJECTOR BULB

BLASTING WHITE in our face.

SLOW MOTION:

SHOSANNA FALLING . . .

EX CU 35MM FILM

MOVING . . .

SHOSANNA:

HITS the DUSTY ground HARD, NOT in slow motion . . .

PROJECTOR BEAM:

SHOOTS OUT OF THE LITTLE PROJECTION BOOTH WINDOW hits screen.

CU SHOSANNA:

on the floor, eyes closed, last breath blown into the dusty projection booth floor. Like her family before here, dead from Nazi bullets.

AUDITORIUM:

ON THE SILVER SCREEN FREDRICK’S EX CU

CUT TO:

ON SILVER SCREEN MATCHING SHOSANNA EX CU

CAMERA in the exact same placement, same background (B/W sky), SLIGHT LOW ANGLE LOOKING UP, so onscreen Shosanna is looking down on the Nazis, the way Fredrick was looking down on the Russians. The way this HUGE IMAGE OF SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE stares down the auditorium of Nazis brings to mind Orwells “1984”

Big Brother.

HITLER and GOEBBELS

React.

HIRSCHBERG:

standing in the middle of the aisle, turns toward the screen. When he sees Shosanna’s GIANT FACE, he’s gobsmacked.

BEHIND SCREEN:

Marcel sitting in the chair, with his cigarette, before the

EVEN MORE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA

SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE ONSCREEN

She stares down the packed house of Nazis and says in FRENCH:

SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE

I have a message for Germany. I’m interrupting your Nazi propaganda horseshit to inform you dispicable German swine that you’re all going to die.

HITLER and GOEBBELS react.

HIRSCHBERG reacts.

MARCEL smiles.

SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE

And I want you to look deep in the face of the

Jew who’s going to do it.

AUDITORIUM AUDIENCE

While the shocked German audience is transfixed to the screen, behind the heads of most of them . . .

The BOMB Landa set in Hitler and Goebbels’s opera box . . .

EXPLODES.

BLOWING TO SMITHEREENS HITLER, FRANCESA, and BOORMANN, and propelling GOEBBELS, still in his theater seat, across the auditorium, into the opposite wall and taking out a portion of the ceiling as well.

The crowd reacts . . .

The explosion causes the huge chandelier from Versailles to topple from its jury-rigged placement and CRASH onto the

audience below . . .

ONSCREEN THE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA finishes her WAR CRY.

SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE

My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face of Jewish vengeance! Marcel, BURN IT DOWN!

BEHIND THE SCREEN

Marcel takes his cigarette and FLICKS IT into the pile of nitrate film.

ONSCREEN SHOSANNA’S GIANT FACE LAUGHS MANIACALLY at the scrambling little Nazis, running in a panic, as FLAMES LIKE

OUT OF A GIANT BLAST FURNACE BURST THROUGH SHOSANNA’S FACE and CLIMB UP THE WALLS of the cinema.

The AUDIENCE

STAMPEDES toward the exits . . .

HIRSCHBERG:

with bomb set on ankle, is caught in a massive “Day of the Locust”

SWARM OF BODIES . . .

People frantically pound on locked doors, trapping them to their grizzly fate.

The FLAMES and FIRE spread through the auditorium . . .

Hirschberg, caught in the people crunch, knows this is it.

HIS ANKLE BOMB GOES OFF

right underneath everybody in the room.

The effect this has on the people in the room is very similar

to that of the effect an M-80 blowing up in an ant hill would have on the ants. The auditorium is a literal red rain of legs, arms, heads, torsos, and asses.

THEN . . . ,

DONOWITZ’S TOILET BOMB

BLOWS UP UNDERNEATH the auditorium.

COLLAPSING THE CINEMA AND BLOWING OUT THE FRONT OF THE THEATER.

As MADAME MIMEUX’S CINEMA BURNS . . .

These SUBTITLES APPEAR ONSCREEN as if on a military teletype:

“OPERATION KINO A COMPLETE SUCCESS.”

FADE OUT:

FADE UP:

“HITLER DEAD. GOEBBELS DEAD. BOORMANN DEAD. GOERING DEAD. ZOLLER DEAD. MOST OF HIGH COMMAND DEAD.”

FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

“FOUR DAYS LATER, GERMANY SURRENDERS.”

FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

“ONCE UPON A TIME IN NAZI . . .

OCCUPIED FRANCE.”

CUT TO:

EXT—WOODS—MORNING

It’s a misty early morning in a woodsy area. The German truck, with Aldo and Utivich in the back, and Landa and Herrman in the front, comes to a stop.

LANDA and HERRMAN IN THE TRUCK CAB

Herrman, behind the wheel, tells Landa in German:

HERRMAN:

These are the American lines, sir.

In the back of the truck sit the two last remaining members of the Basterds, Lt. Aldo Raine and Pfc. Smithson Utivich, both with their hands cuffed behind their backs.

Landa and Herrman appear at the truck rear. Landa says in ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA

Okay, gentlemen, you can climb down.

Aldo and Utivich climb down from the truck.

Col. Landa indicates for Herrman to remove the handcuffs from the two prisoners.

He does.

COL. LANDA

Herrman, hand them your weapon.

He does.

Col. Landa hands over his LUGER and his very-cool-looking S.S.

DAGGER.

COL. LANDA

I am officially surrendering myself

over to you, Lieutenant Raine. We are your prisoners.

LT. ALDO

Thank you very much, Colonel. Utivich, cuff the colonel’s hands behind his back.

COL. LANDA

Is that really necessary?

As Utivich cuffs the Colonel’s hands behind his back, Aldo says:

LT. ALDO

I’m a slave to appearances.

Then Aldo takes the Luger and SHOOTS HERRMAN DEAD.

The bound Col. Landa is appalled.

COL. LANDA

Are you mad? What have you done? I made a deal with your general for that man’s life!

LT. ALDO

Yeah, they made that deal, but they don’t give a fuck about him, they

need you.

COL. LANDA

You’ll be shot for this.

LT. ALDO

Naw, I don’t think so, more like I’ll

be chewed out. I’ve been chewed out before. You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass. End the war tonight? I’d make that deal. How ’bout you, Utivich, you make that deal?

UTIVICH:

I’d make that deal.

LT. ALDO

I don’t blame ya. Damn good deal. And that pretty little nest ya feathered for yourself. Well, if

you’re willing to barbecue the whole high command, I suppose that’s worth certain considerations. Now I don’t

care about you gettin’ pensions, merit badges, ticker-tape parades, who gives a damn, let’s all go home. But I do have one question.

When you go to your little place on Nantucket island, I imagine you gonna take off that handsome-looking S.S. uniform of yours, ain’t ya?

For the first time in the movie, Col. Landa doesn’t respond.

LT. ALDO

That’s what I thought. Now that . . .

. . . I can’t abide. How bout you, Utivich, can you abide it?

UTIVICH:

Not one damn bit, sir.

LT. ALDO

I mean if I had my way, you’d wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of our pecker-suckin’ life. But I’m aware that ain’t practical. I mean

at some point ya gotta hafta take it off.

He opens Landa’s S.S. DAGGER and holds the blade in front of Hans’s face.

LT. ALDO

So I’m gonna give you a little somethin you can’t take off.

CU COL. LANDA

The dagger has just completed carving a swastika deep into his forehead.

COL. LANDA’S POV

On the ground, looking up at Aldo, bloody knife in hand, who straddles him. And Utivich, who’s next to him. The two Basterds admire Aldo’s handiwork.

Aldo turns to Uitivich and says:

LT. ALDO

You know somethin’, Utivich? I think this just might be my masterpiece.

They ghoulishly giggle.

INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles.
It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed,
there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching
on bacon and eating eggs.

Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The
Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and,
like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're
going out of style.

It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or
how old she is; everything she does contradicts something
she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is
to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.

YOUNG MAN
No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm
through doin' that shit.

YOUNG WOMAN
You always say that, the same thing
every time: never again, I'm through,
too dangerous.

YOUNG MAN
I know that's what I always say. I'm
always right too, but –

YOUNG WOMAN
– but you forget about it in a day
or two -

YOUNG MAN
– yeah, well, the days of me
forgittin' are over, and the days of
me rememberin' have just begun.

YOUNG WOMAN
When you go on like this, you know
what you sound like?

YOUNG MAN
I sound like a sensible fucking man,
is what I sound like.

YOUNG WOMAN
You sound like a duck.
(imitates a duck)
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack...

YOUNG MAN
Well take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna hafta hear it again. Because
since I'm never gonna do it again,
you're never gonna hafta hear me
quack about how I'm never gonna do
it again.

YOUNG WOMAN
After tonight.

The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in
there, back and forth.

YOUNG MAN
(with a smile)
Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

WAITRESS
Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh yes, thank you.

The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man
lights up another cigarette.

YOUNG MAN
I'm doin' fine.

The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his
smoke.

The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her
coffee.

The Young Man goes right back into it.

YOUNG MAN
I mean the way it is now, you're
takin' the same fuckin' risk as when
you rob a bank. You take more of a
risk. Banks are easier! Federal
banks aren't supposed to stop you
anyway, during a robbery. They're
insured, why should they care? You
don't even need a gun in a federal
bank. I heard about this guy, walked
into a federal bank with a portable
phone, handed the phone to the teller,
the guy on the other end of the phone
said: "We got this guy's little girl,
and if you don't give him all your
money, we're gonna kill 'er."

YOUNG WOMAN
Did it work?

YOUNG MAN
Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm
talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in
a bank with a telephone, not a pistol,
not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone,
cleans the place out, and they don't
lift a fuckin' finger.

YOUNG WOMAN
Did they hurt the little girl?

YOUNG MAN
I don't know. There probably never
was a little girl – the point of the
story isn't the little girl. The
point of the story is they robbed
the bank with a telephone.

YOUNG WOMAN
You wanna rob banks?

YOUNG MAN
I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks,
I'm just illustrating that if we
did, it would be easier than what we
been doin'.

YOUNG WOMAN
So you don't want to be a bank robber?

YOUNG MAN
Naw, all those guys are goin' down
the same road, either dead or servin'
twenty.

YOUNG WOMAN
And no more liquor stores?

YOUNG MAN
What have we been talking about?
Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides,
it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too
many foreigners own liquor stores.
Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't
fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em:
"Empty out the register," and they
don't know what it fuckin' means.
They make it too personal. We keep
on, one of those gook motherfuckers'
gonna make us kill 'em.

YOUNG WOMAN
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

YOUNG MAN
I don't wanna kill anybody either.
But they'll probably put us in a
situation where it's us of them. And
if it's not the gooks, it these old
Jews who've owned the store for
fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got
Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the
counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try
walkin' into one of those stores
with nothin' but a telephone, see
how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget
it, we're out of it.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well, what else is there, day jobs?

YOUNG MAN
(laughing)
Not this life.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well what then?

He calls to the Waitress.

YOUNG MAN
Garcon! Coffee!

Then looks to his girl.

YOUNG MAN
This place.

The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.

WAITRESS
(snotty)
"Garcon" means boy.

She splits.

YOUNG WOMAN
Here? It's a coffee shop.

YOUNG MAN
What's wrong with that? People never
rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor
stores, gas stations, you get your
head blown off stickin' up one of
them. Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.
They're not expecting to get robbed,
or not as expecting.

YOUNG WOMAN
(taking to idea)
I bet in places like this you could
cut down on the hero factor.

YOUNG MAN
Correct. Just like banks, these places
are insured. The managers don't give
a fuck, they're just tryin' to get
ya out the door before you start
pluggin' diners. Waitresses, forget
it, they ain't takin' a bullet for
the register. Busboys, some wetback
gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour
gonna really give a fuck you're
stealin' from the owner. Customers
are sittin' there with food in their
mouths, they don't know what's goin'
on. One minute they're havin' a Denver
omelet, next minute somebody's
stickin' a gun in their face.

The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man
continues in a low voice.

YOUNG MAN
See, I got the idea last liquor store
we stuck up. 'Member all those
customers kept comin' in?

YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah.

YOUNG MAN
Then you got the idea to take
everybody's wallet.

YOUNG WOMAN
Uh-huh.

YOUNG MAN
That was a good idea.

YOUNG WOMAN
Thanks.

YOUNG MAN
We made more from the wallets then
we did the register.

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes we did.

YOUNG MAN
A lot of people go to restaurants.

YOUNG WOMAN
A lot of wallets.

YOUNG MAN
Pretty smart, huh?

The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new
information.

She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The
tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the
motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the
COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's
face.

YOUNG WOMAN
Pretty smart.
(into it)
I'm ready, let's go, right here,
right now.

YOUNG MAN
Remember, same as before, you're
crowd control, I handle the employees.

YOUNG WOMAN
Got it.

They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on
the table. He looks at her and she back at him.

YOUNG WOMAN
I love you, Pumpkin.

YOUNG MAN
I love you, Honey Bunny.

And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons,
stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona
is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is
that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.

PUMPKIN
(yelling to all)
Everybody be cool this is a robbery!

HONEY BUNNY
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
I'll execute every one of you
motherfuckers! Got that?

"PULP FICTION"

INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING

An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS
down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front
seat are two young fellas – one white, one black – both
wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long
green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES
WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.

JULES
– Okay now, tell me about the hash
bars?

VINCENT
What so you want to know?

JULES
Well, hash is legal there, right?

VINCENT
Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a
hundred percent legal. I mean you
can't walk into a restaurant, roll a
joint, and start puffin' away. You're
only supposed to smoke in your home
or certain designated places.

JULES
Those are hash bars?

VINCENT
Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's
legal to buy it, it's legal to own
it and, if you're the proprietor of
a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
It's legal to carry it, which doesn't
really matter 'cause – get a load of
this – if the cops stop you, it's
illegal for this to search you.
Searching you is a right that the
cops in Amsterdam don't have.

JULES
That did it, man – I'm fuckin' goin',
that's all there is to it.

VINCENT
You'll dig it the most. But you know
what the funniest thing about Europe
is?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
It's the little differences. A lotta
the same shit we got here, they got
there, but there they're a little
different.

JULES
Examples?

VINCENT
Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer
in a movie theatre. And I don't mean
in a paper cup either. They give you
a glass of beer, like in a bar. In
Paris, you can buy beer at
MacDonald's. Also, you know what
they call a Quarter Pounder with
Cheese in Paris?

JULES
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder
with Cheese?

VINCENT
No, they got the metric system there,
they wouldn't know what the fuck a
Quarter Pounder is.

JULES
What'd they call it?

VINCENT
Royale with Cheese.

JULES
(repeating)
Royale with Cheese. What'd they call
a Big Mac?

VINCENT
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call
it Le Big Mac.

JULES
Le Big Mac. What do they call a
Whopper?

VINCENT
I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger
King. But you know what they put on
french fries in Holland instead of
ketchup?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
Mayonnaise.

JULES
Goddamn!

VINCENT
I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a
little bit on the side of the plate,
they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

JULES
Uuccch!

CUT TO:

INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) – MORNING

The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach
inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking
them.

JULES
We should have shotguns for this
kind of deal.

VINCENT
How many up there?

JULES
Three or four.

VINCENT
Counting our guy?

JULES
I'm not sure.

VINCENT
So there could be five guys up there?

JULES
It's possible.

VINCENT
We should have fuckin' shotguns.

They CLOSE the trunk.

CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING

Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically
dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what
looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

We TRACK alongside.

VINCENT
What's her name?

JULES
Mia.

VINCENT
How did Marsellus and her meet?

JULES
I dunno, however people meet people.
She usta be an actress.

VINCENT
She ever do anything I woulda saw?

JULES
I think her biggest deal was she
starred in a pilot.

VINCENT
What's a pilot?

JULES
Well, you know the shows on TV?

VINCENT
I don't watch TV.

JULES
Yes, but you're aware that there's
an invention called television, and
on that invention they show shows?

VINCENT
Yeah.

JULES
Well, the way they pick the shows on
TV is they make one show, and that
show's called a pilot. And they show
that one show to the people who pick
the shows, and on the strength of
that one show, they decide if they
want to make more shows. Some get
accepted and become TV programs, and
some don't, and become nothing. She
starred in one of the ones that became
nothing.

They enter the apartment building.

INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) – MORNING

Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait
for the elevator.

JULES
You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-
black, half-Samoan, usta call him
Tony Rocky Horror.

VINCENT
Yeah maybe, fat right?

JULES
I wouldn't go so far as to call the
brother fat. He's got a weight
problem. What's the nigger gonna
do, he's Samoan.

VINCENT
I think I know who you mean, what
about him?

JULES
Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up
good. And word around the campfire,
it was on account of Marsellus
Wallace's wife.

The elevator arrives, the men step inside.

INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING

VINCENT
What'd he do, fuck her?

JULES
No no no no no no no, nothin' that
bad.

VINCENT
Well what then?

JULES
He gave her a foot massage.

VINCENT
A foot massage?

Jules nods his head: "Yes."

VINCENT
That's all?

Jules nods his head: "Yes."

VINCENT
What did Marsellus do?

JULES
Sent a couple of guys over to his
place. They took him out on the
patio of his apartment, threw his
ass over the balcony. Nigger fell
four stories. They had this garden
at the bottom, enclosed in glass,
like one of them greenhouses – nigger
fell through that. Since then, he's
kinda developed a speech impediment.

The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.

VINCENT
That's a damn shame.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING

STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline
down the hall.

VINCENT
Still I hafta say, play with matches,
ya get burned.

JULES
Whaddya mean?

VINCENT
You don't be givin' Marsellus
Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

JULES
You don't think he overreacted?

VINCENT
Antwan probably didn't expect
Marsellus to react like he did, but
he had to expect a reaction.

JULES
It was a foot massage, a foot massage
is nothing, I give my mother a foot
massage.

VINCENT
It's laying hands on Marsellus
Wallace's new wife in a familiar
way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out
– no, but you're in the same fuckin'
ballpark.

Jules stops Vincent.

JULES
Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right
there. Eatin' a bitch out, and givin'
a bitch a foot massage ain't even
the same fuckin' thing.

VINCENT
Not the same thing, the same ballpark.

JULES
It ain't no ballpark either. Look
maybe your method of massage differs
from mine, but touchin' his lady's
feet, and stickin' your tongue in
her holyiest of holyies, ain't the
same ballpark, ain't the same league,
ain't even the same fuckin' sport.
Foot massages don't mean shit.

VINCENT
Have you ever given a foot massage?

JULES
Don't be tellin' me about foot
massages – I'm the foot fuckin'
master.

VINCENT
Given a lot of 'em?

JULES
Shit yeah. I got my technique down
man, I don't tickle or nothin'.

VINCENT
Have you ever given a guy a foot
massage?

Jules looks at him a long moment – he's been set up.

JULES
Fuck you.

He starts walking down the hall. Vincent, smiling, walks a
little bit behind.

VINCENT
How many?

JULES
Fuck you.

VINCENT
Would you give me a foot massage –
I'm kinda tired.

JULES
Man, you best back off, I'm gittin'
pissed – this is the door.

The two men stand in front of the door numbered "49." They
whisper.

JULES
What time is it?

VINCENT
(checking his watch)
Seven-twenty-two in the morning.

JULES
It ain't quite time, let's hang back.

They move a little away from the door, facing each other,
still whispering.

JULES
Look, just because I wouldn't give
no man a foot massage, don't make it
right for Marsellus to throw Antwan
off a building into a glass-
motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the
way the nigger talks. That ain't
right, man. Motherfucker do that to
me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause
I'd kill'a motherfucker.

VINCENT
I'm not sayin' he was right, but
you're sayin' a foot massage don't
mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does.
I've given a million ladies a million
foot massages and they all meant
somethin'. We act like they don't,
but they do. That's what's so fuckin'
cool about 'em. This sensual thing's
goin' on that nobody's talkin about,
but you know it and she knows it,
fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan
shoulda known fuckin' better. That's
his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna
have a sense of humor about that
shit.

JULES
That's an interesting point, but
let's get into character.

VINCENT
What's her name again?

JULES
Mia. Why you so interested in big
man's wife?

VINCENT
Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida
and when he's gone, he wants me to
take care of Mia.

JULES
Take care of her?

Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.

VINCENT
Not that! Take her out. Show her a
good time. Don't let her get lonely.

JULES
You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace
out on a date?

VINCENT
It ain't a date. It's like when you
and your buddy's wife go to a movie
or somethin'. It's just... you know...
good company.

Jules just looks at him.

VINCENT
It's not a date.

Jules just looks at him.

INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING

THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a
table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.

One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to
REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.

JULES
Hey kids.

The two men stroll inside.

The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:

MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the
scene progresses, back into the corner.

ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of
Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the
table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in
their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.

JULES
How you boys doin'?

No answer.

JULES
(to Brett)
Am I trippin', or did I just ask you
a question.

BRETT
We're doin' okay.

As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

JULES
Do you know who we are?

Brett shakes his head: "No."

JULES
We're associates of your business
partner Marsellus Wallace, you
remember your business partner
dont'ya?

No answer.

JULES
(to Brett)
Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here:
you're Brett, right?

BRETT
I'm Brett.

JULES
I thought so. Well, you remember
your business partner Marsellus
Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

BRETT
I remember him.

JULES
Good for you. Looks like me and
Vincent caught you at breakfast,
sorry 'bout that. What'cha eatin'?

BRETT
Hamburgers.

JULES
Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any
nutritious breakfast. What kinda
hamburgers?

BRETT
Cheeseburgers.

JULES
No, I mean where did you get'em?
MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-
Box, where?

BRETT
Big Kahuna Burger.

JULES
Big Kahuna Burger. That's that
Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they
got some tasty burgers. I ain't never
had one myself, how are they?

BRETT
They're good.

JULES
Mind if I try one of yours?

BRETT
No.

JULES
Yours is this one, right?

BRETT
Yeah.

Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.

JULES
Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.
(to Vincent)
Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna
Burger?

VINCENT
No.

Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.

JULES
You wanna bite, they're real good.

VINCENT
I ain't hungry.

JULES
Well, if you like hamburgers give
'em a try sometime. Me, I can't
usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's
a vegetarian. Which more or less
makes me a vegetarian, but I sure
love the taste of a good burger.
(to Brett)
You know what they call a Quarter
Pounder with Cheese in France?

BRETT
No.

JULES
Tell 'em, Vincent.

VINCENT
Royale with Cheese.

JULES
Royale with Cheese, you know why
they call it that?

BRETT
Because of the metric system?

JULES
Check out the big brain on Brett.
You'a smart motherfucker, that's
right. The metric system.
(he points to a fast
food drink cup)
What's in this?

BRETT
Sprite.

JULES
Sprite, good, mind if I have some of
your tasty beverage to wash this
down with?

BRETT
Sure.

Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.

JULES
Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!
(to Roger)
You, Flock of Seagulls, you know
what we're here for?

Roger nods his head: "Yes."

JULES
Then why don't you tell my boy here
Vince, where you got the shit hid.

MARVIN
It's under the be –

JULES
– I don't remember askin' you a
goddamn thing.
(to Roger)
You were sayin'?

ROGER
It's under the bed.

Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out
a black snap briefcase.

VINCENT
Got it.

Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see
what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent
just stares at it, transfixed.

JULES
We happy?

No answer from the transfixed Vincent.

JULES
Vincent!

Vincent looks up at Jules.

JULES
We happy?

Closing the case.

VINCENT
We're happy.

BRETT
(to Jules)
Look, what's your name? I got his
name's Vincent, but what's yours?

JULES
My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin'
your ass outta this shit.

BRETT
I just want you to know how sorry we
are about how fucked up things got
between us and Mr. Wallace. When we
entered into this thing, we only had
the best intentions –

As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger
three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.

Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.

Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering,
but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

JULES
(to Brett)
Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your
concentration? I didn't mean to do
that. Please, continue. I believe
you were saying something about "best
intentions."

Brett can't say a word.

JULES
Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through
anyway. Well, let me retort. Would
you describe for me what Marsellus
Wallace looks like?

Brett still can't speak.

Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing
the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits
in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in
front of an interrogator.

JULES
What country you from!

BRETT
(petrified)
What?

JULES
"What" ain't no country I know! Do
they speak English in "What?"

BRETT
(near heart attack)
What?

JULES
English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-
it?

BRETT
Yes.

JULES
Then you understand what I'm sayin'?

BRETT
Yes.

JULES
Now describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

BRETT
(out of fear)
What?

Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's
cheek.

JULES
Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What"
again! I dare ya, I double dare ya
motherfucker, say "What" one more
goddamn time!

Brett is regressing on the spot.

JULES
Now describe to me what Marsellus
Wallace looks like!

Brett does his best.

BRETT
Well he's... he's... black –

JULES
– go on!

BRETT
...and he's... he's... bald –

JULES
– does he look like a bitch?!

BRETT
(without thinking)
What?

Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his
eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder.

Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in
the chair.

JULES
Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!

BRETT
(in agony)
No.

JULES
Then why did you try to fuck 'im
like a bitch?!

BRETT
(in spasm)
I didn't.

Now in a lower voice.

JULES
Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck
'im. You ever read the Bible, Brett?

BRETT
(in spasm)
Yes.

JULES
There's a passage I got memorized,
seems appropriate for this situation:
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness, for he is
truly his brother's keeper and the
finder of lost children. And I will
strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know my name
is the Lord when I lay my vengeance
upon you."

The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting
Brett.

AGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD:

"VINCENT VEGA AND MARSELLUS WALLACE'S WIFE"

FADE IN:

MEDIUM SHOT – BUTCH COOLIDGE

We FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old
prizefighter. Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue
high school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is
everybody's boss MARSELLUS WALLACE. The black man sounds
like a cross between a gangster and a king.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
I think you're gonna find – when all
this shit is over and done – I think
you're gonna find yourself one smilin'
motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right
now you got ability. But painful as
it may be, ability don't last. Now
that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of
life, but it's a fact of life your
ass is gonna hafta git realistic
about. This business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic
motherfuckers who thought their ass
aged like wine. Besides, even if
you went all the way, what would you
be? Feather-weight champion of the
world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you
can even get a credit card based on
that.

A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front
of Butch. Butch picks it up.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Now the night of the fight, you may
fell a slight sting, that's pride
fuckin' wit ya. Fuck pride! Pride
only hurts, it never helps. Fight
through that shit. 'Cause a year
from now, when you're kickin' it in
the Caribbean you're gonna say,
"Marsellus Wallace was right."

BUTCH
I got no problem with that.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
In the fifth, your ass goes down.

Butch nods his head: "yes."

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Say it!

BUTCH
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

CUT TO:

INT. CAR (MOVING) – DAY

Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964
cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio,
ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT.

EXT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY

Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus
owns.

Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking
lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic.

Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked,
revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE.
Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin
Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally
LeRoy's.

ENGLISH DAVE
Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam,
git your ass on in here.

Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between
Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door
in our faces.

INT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY

The spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave
crosses to the bar, and Vince follows.

VINCENT
Where's the big man?

ENGLISH DAVE
He's over there, finishing up some
business.

VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with
his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of
yet still UNSEEN Marsellus.

ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
Hang back for a second or two, and
when you see the white boy leave, go
on over. In the meanwhile, can I
make you an espresso?

VINCENT
How 'bout a cup of just plain lo'
American?

ENGLISH DAVE
Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia
out tomorrow?

VINCENT
At Marsellus' request.

ENGLISH DAVE
Have you met Mia?

VINCENT
Not yet.

English Dave smiles to himself.

VINCENT
What's so funny?

ENGLISH DAVE
Not a goddamn thing.

VINCENT
Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big
man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit
across a table, chew my food with my
mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and
that's all I'm gonna do.

English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.

ENGLISH DAVE
My name's Paul, and this is between
y'all.

Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his
cup of "Plain ol' American."

BUTCH
(to English Dave)
Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?

ENGLISH DAVE
Filters?

BUTCH
Non.

While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his
coffee, staring at him. Butch looks over at him.

BUTCH
Lookin' at somethin', friend?

VINCENT
I ain't your friend, palooka.

Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.

BUTCH
What was that?

VINCENT
I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.

Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Vincent Vega has entered the building,
git your ass over here!

Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another
glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME,
looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching
business.

BUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure
that is Marsellus.

Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend
of Marsellus, he better let it go – for now.

ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.

Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays
English Dave and walks out of the SHOT.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) – NIGHT

CLOSEUP – JODY

A woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. Both of
her ears are pierced five times. She also sports rings in
her lips, eyebrows and nose.

JODY
...I'll lend it to you. It's a great
book on body piercing.

Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen
table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is
at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.

TRUDI
You know how they use that gun when
they pierce your ears? They don't
use that when they pierce your
nipples, do they?

JODY
Forget that gun. That gun goes against
the entire idea behind piercing. All
of my piercing, sixteen places on my
body, every one of 'em done with a
needle. Five in each ear. One through
the nipple on my left breast. One
through my right nostril. One through
my left eyebrow. One through my lip.
One in my clit. And I wear a stud in
my tongue.

Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear
and out the other, until that last remark.

VINCENT
(interrupting)
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm
curious, why would you get a stud in
your tongue?

Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious
thing in the world.

JODY
It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.

That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it
makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent
to ponder the truth of her statement.

LANCE (O.S.)
Vince, you can come in now!

INT. LANCE'S BEDROOM – NIGHT

Lance, late 20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly
appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly
personality. LANCE has been selling drugs his entire adult
life. He's never had a day job, never filed a tax return and
has never been arrested. He wears a red flannel shirt over a
"Speed Racer" tee-shirt.

Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed.

Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed.

LANCE
Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very
good stuff. This is Bava, different,
but equally good. And this is Choco
from the Hartz Mountains of Germany.
Now the first two are the same, forty-
five an ounce – those are friend
prices – but this one...
(pointing to the Choco)
...this one's a little more expensive.
It's fifty-five. But when you shoot
it, you'll know where that extra
money went. Nothing wrong with the
first two. It's real, real, real,
good shit. But this one's a fuckin'
madman.

VINCENT
Remember, I just got back from
Amsterdam.

LANCE
Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood?
No. You're in my house. White people
who know the difference between good
shit and bad shit, this is the house
they come to. My shit, I'll take the
Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit
any ol' day of the fuckin' week.

VINCENT
That's a bold statement.

LANCE
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is
a seller's market. Coke is fuckin'
dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole
seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin,
they're as hot as hell.

Vincent takes out a roll of money that would choke a horse
to death.

VINCENT
Give me three hundred worth of the
madman. If it's as good as you say,
I'll be back for a thousand.

LANCE
I just hope I still have it. Whaddya
think of Trudi? She ain't got a
boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get
high?

VINCENT
Which one's Trudi? The one with all
the shit in her face?

LANCE
No, that's Jody. That's my wife.

Vincent and Lance giggle at the "faux pas."

VINCENT
I'm on my way somewhere. I got a
dinner engagement. Rain check?

LANCE
No problem?

Vincent takes out his case of the works (utensils for shooting
up).

VINCENT
You don't mind if I shoot up here?

LANCE
Me casa, su casa.

VINCENT
Mucho gracias.

Vincent takes his works out of his case and, as the two
continue to talk, Vince shoots up.

LANCE
Still got your Malibu?

VINCENT
You know what some fucker did to it
the other day?

LANCE
What?

VINCENT
Fuckin' keyed it.

LANCE
Oh man, that's fucked up.

VINCENT
Tell me about it. I had the goddamn
thing in storage three years. It's
out five fuckin' days – five days,
and some dickless piece of shit fucks
with it.

LANCE
They should be fuckin' killed. No
trial, no jury, straight to execution.

As he cooks his heroin...

VINCENT
I just wish I caught 'em doin' it,
ya know? Oh man, I'd give anything
to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been
worth his doin' it, if I coulda just
caught 'em, you know what I mean?

LANCE
It's chicken shit. You don't fuck
another man's vehicle.

CLOSEUP – THE NEEDLE

Going into Vincent's vein.

CLOSEUP – BLOOD

Spurting back into the syringe, mixing with the heroin.

CLOSEUP – VINCENT'S THUMB

Pushing down on the plunger.

CUT TO:

EXT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

Vincent walks toward the house and pulls a note off the door

CLOSEUP – NOTE

The Note reads:

"Hi Vincent, I'm getting dressed. The door's open. Come inside
and make yourself a drink. Mia"

MIA (V.O.)
Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed.
The door's open. Come inside and
make yourself a drink.

FADE TO WHITE

Music in.

FADE TO:

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent enters on the background.

VINCENT
Hello?

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA, Marcellus' beautiful young wife. Video screens are in
the background. Dusty Springfield is singing "SON OF A
PREACHER MAN".

Mia's mouth comes toward a microphone.

MIA
(into microphone)
Vincent.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent turns.

MIA
(over intercom)
Vincent. I'm on the intercom.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(into microphone)
It's on the wall by the two African
fellas.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(over intercom)
To your right.

Vincent walks.

MIA
...warm. Warmer. Disco.

Vincent finds the intercom on the wall.

VINCENT
Hello.

MIA
(over intercom)
Push the button if you want to talk.

VINCENT
(into intercom)
Hello.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(into microphone)
Go make yourself a drink., and I'll
be down in two shakes of a lamb's
tail.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(over intercom)
The bar's by the fireplace.

VINCENT
(into intercom)
Okay.
(licks lips)

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

A video screen with an image of Vincent, walking. The Dusty
Springfield song continues.

Mia turns a knob which controls the movement of the video
camera in Marcellus' living room.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent picks up a bottle of scotch. He sniffs the bottle,
and then pours it into a glass.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

A razor blade cuts cocaine on a mirror.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent drinks a glass of scotch.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

Mia sniffs the cocaine.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent sips the drink and looks at a portrait of Mia on the
wall.

Mia walks into the room, and takes the needle off a record.
The Dusty Springfield song stops.

MIA
Let's go.

EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT

In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over
L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're
all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book,
Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer,
saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the
Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and
over prices that pay for all this bullshit.

But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's
diners.

Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of
view.

Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with
a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a
red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath
the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that
is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."

VINCENT
What the fuck is this place?

MIA
This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis
man should love it.

VINCENT
Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.

MIA
You can get a steak here, daddy-o.
Don't be a...

Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on
the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.

VINCENT
After you, kitty-cat.

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT

Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint
English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over
the wall

("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF
THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that
the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s
cars.

In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign
on the wall states, "No shoes allowed." Some wannabe beboppers
(actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or
barefeet.

The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead,
B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The
WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons:
MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and
LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing
appropriate costumes.

Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red
'59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting
a big button on his chest that says: "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing
you please me."

BUDDY
Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?

VINCENT
I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

BUDDY
How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp,
or bloody as hell?

VINCENT
Bloody as hell. And to drink, a
vanilla coke.

BUDDY
How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?

MIA
I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger –
bloody – and a five-dollar shake.

BUDDY
How d'ya want that shake, Martin and
Lewis, or Amos and Andy?

MIA
Martin and Lewis.

VINCENT
Did you just order a five-dollar
shake?

MIA
Sure did.

VINCENT
A shake? Milk and ice cream?

MIA
Uh-huh.

VINCENT
It costs five dollars?

BUDDY
Yep.

VINCENT
You don't put bourbon in it or
anything?

BUDDY
Nope.

VINCENT
Just checking.

Buddy exits.

Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are
dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers,
and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing,
The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her
customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a
fool.

MIA
Whaddya think?

VINCENT
It's like a wax museum with a pulse
rate.

Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling
himself a smoke.

After a second of watching him –

MIA
What are you doing?

VINCENT
Rollin' a smoke.

MIA
Here?

VINCENT
It's just tobacco.

MIA
Oh. Well in that case, will you roll
me one, cowboy?

As he finishes licking it –

VINCENT
You can have this one, cowgirl.

He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to
her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's
hand. He lights it.

MIA
Thanks.

VINCENT
Think nothing of it.

He begins rolling one for himself.

As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner,
making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a
square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS
the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out
a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.

Back to Mia and Vincent.

MIA
Marsellus said you just got back
from Amsterdam.

VINCENT
Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.

MIA
That was my fifteen minutes.

VINCENT
What was it?

MIA
It was show about a team of female
secret agents called "Fox Force Five."

VINCENT
What?

MIA
"Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a
bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in
we're a force to be reckoned with.
Five, as in there's one... two ...
three... four... five of us. There
was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal
from that show "Baton Rouge," she
was the leader. A Japanese one, a
black one, a French one and a brunette
one, me. We all had special skills.
Sommerset had a photographic memory,
the Japanese fox was a kung fu master,
the black girl was a demolition
expert, the French fox' specialty
was sex...

VINCENT
What was your specialty?

MIA
Knives. The character I played, Raven
McCoy, her background was she was
raised by circus performers. So she
grew up doing a knife act. According
to the show, she was the deadliest
woman in the world with a knife. But
because she grew up in a circus, she
was also something of an acrobat.
She could do illusions, she was a
trapeze artist – when you're keeping
the world safe from evil, you never
know when being a trapeze artist's
gonna come in handy. And she knew a
zillion old jokes her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her. If
we woulda got picked up, they woulda
worked in a gimmick where every
episode I woulda told and ol joke.

VINCENT
Do you remember any of the jokes?

MIA
Well I only got the chance to say
one, 'cause we only did one show.

VINCENT
Tell me.

MIA
No. It's really corny.

VINCENT
C'mon, don't be that way.

MIA
No. You won't like it and I'll be
embarrassed.

VINCENT
You told it in front of fifty million
people and you can't tell it to me?
I promise I won't laugh.

MIA
(laughing)
That's what I'm afraid of.

VINCENT
That's not what I meant and you know
it.

MIA
You're quite the silver tongue devil,
aren't you?

VINCENT
I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.

MIA
That's not what you said Vince. Well
now I'm definitely not gonna tell
ya, 'cause it's been built up too
much.

VINCENT
What a gyp.

Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around
the straw of her shake.

MIA
Yummy!

VINCENT
Can I have a sip of that? I'd like
to know what a five-dollar shake
tastes like.

MIA
Be my guest.

She slides the shake over to him.

MIA
You can use my straw, I don't have
kooties.

Vincent smiles.

VINCENT
Yeah, but maybe I do.

MIA
Kooties I can handle.

He takes a sip.

VINCENT
Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin'
good milk shake.

MIA
Told ya.

VINCENT
I don't know if it's worth five
dollars, but it's pretty fuckin'
good.

He slides the shake back.

Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.

MIA
Don't you hate that?

VINCENT
What?

MIA
Uncomfortable silences. Why do we
feel it's necessary to yak about
bullshit in order to be comfortable?

VINCENT
I don't know.

MIA
That's when you know you found
somebody special. When you can just
shit the fuck up for a minute, and
comfortably share silence.

VINCENT
I don't think we're there yet. But
don't feel bad, we just met each
other.

MIA
Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to
the bathroom and powder my nose,
while you sit here and think of
something to say.

VINCENT
I'll do that.

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM) – NIGHT

Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the
bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.

MIA
(imitating Steppenwolf)
I said goddamn!

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT

Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his
eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.

Mia comes back to the table.

MIA
Don't you love it when you go to the
bathroom and you come back to find
your food waiting for you?

VINCENT
We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy
Holly doesn't seem to be much of a
waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn
Monroe's section.

MIA
Which one, there's two Marilyn
Monroes.

VINCENT
No there's not.

Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.

VINCENT
That's Marilyn Monroe...

Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and
capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS –

VINCENT
... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I
don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it
must be her night off.

MIA
Pretty smart.

VINCENT
I have moments.

MIA
Did ya think of something to say?

VINCENT
Actually, there's something I've
wanted to ask you about, but you
seem like a nice person, and I didn't
want to offend you.

MIA
Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like
mindless, boring, getting-to-know-
you chit-chat. This sounds like you
actually have something to say.

VINCENT
Only if you promise not to get
offended.

MIA
You can't promise something like
that. I have no idea what you're
gonna ask. You could ask me what
you're gonna ask me, and my natural
response could be to be offended.
Then, through no fault of my own, I
woulda broken my promise.

VINCENT
Then let's just forget it.

MIA
That is an impossibility. Trying to
forget anything as intriguing as
this would be an exercise in futility.

VINCENT
Is that a fact?

Mia nods her head: "Yes."

MIA
Besides, it's more exciting when you
don't have permission.

VINCENT
What do you think about what happened
to Antwan?

MIA
Who's Antwan?

VINCENT
Tony Rocky Horror.

MIA
He fell out of a window.

VINCENT
That's one way to say it. Another
way is, he was thrown out. Another
was is, he was thrown out by
Marsellus. And even another way is,
he was thrown out of a window by
Marsellus because of you.

MIA
Is that a fact?

VINCENT
No it's not, it's just what I heard.

MIA
Who told you this?

VINCENT
They.

Mia and Vincent smile.

MIA
They talk a lot, don't they?

VINCENT
They certainly do.

MIA
Well don't by shy Vincent, what
exactly did they say?

Vincent is slow to answer.

MIA
Let me help you Bashful, did it
involve the F-word?

VINCENT
No. They just said Rocky Horror gave
you a foot massage.

MIA
And...?

VINCENT
No and, that's it.

MIA
You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror
out of a four-story window because
he massaged my feet?

VINCENT
Yeah.

MIA
And you believed that?

VINCENT
At the time I was told, it seemed
reasonable.

MIA
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a
four story window for giving me a
foot massage seemed reasonable?

VINCENT
No, it seemed excessive. But that
doesn't mean it didn't happen. I
heard Marsellus is very protective
of you.

MIA
A husband being protective of his
wife is one thing. A husband almost
killing another man for touching his
wife's feet is something else.

VINCENT
But did it happen?

MIA
The only thing Antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand, when he shook
it. I met Anwan once – at my wedding
– then never again. The truth is,
nobody knows why Marsellus tossed
Tony Rocky Horror out of that window
except Marsellus and Tony Rocky
Horror. But when you scamps get
together, you're worse than a sewing
circle.

CUT TO:

ED SULLIVAN AND MARILYN MONROE STAND ON STAGE

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment
you've all been waiting for, the
worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist
contest.

Patrons cheer.

handsome trophy that Marilyn here is
holding.

Marilyn holds the trophy.

ED SULLIVAN
...Now, who will be our first

Mia holds her hand.

MIA
Right here.

Vincent reacts.

MIA
I wanna dance.

VINCENT
No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.

MIA
(overlapping)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do
believe Marsellus, my husband, your
boss, told you to take me out and do
whatever I wanted, Now, I want to
dance. I want to win. I want that
trophy.

VINCENT
(sighs)
All right.

MIA
So, dance good.

VINCENT
All right, you asked for it.

Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
Let's hear it for our first
contestants.

Patrons cheer.

Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.

ED SULLIVAN
Now let's meet our first contestants
here this evening. Young lady, what
is your name?

MIA
(into microphone)
Missus Mia Wallace.

And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?

MIA
(into microphone)
Vincent Vega.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
All right, let's see what you can
do. Take it away!

Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL".
They make hand movements as they dance.

INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME – NIGHT

The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-
style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the
previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.

Then...

The two just stand face to face looking at each other.

VINCENT
Was than an uncomfortable silence?

MIA
I don't know what that was.
(pause)
Music and drinks!

Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his
overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.

VINCENT
I'm gonna take a piss.

MIA
That was a little bit more information
than I needed to know, but go right
ahead.

Vincent shuffles off to the john.

Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs
and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high
energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She
dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's
overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It
feels good.

Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch.
Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco
on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks
the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a
little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so
anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out
his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg,
trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you
know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly
brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up,
then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.

The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she
takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in
the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something
else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder
inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance.
Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her
face.

MIA
(like you would say
Bingo!)
Disco! Vince, you little cola nut,
you've been holding out on me.

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) – NIGHT

Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to
himself in the mirror.

VINCENT
One drink and leave. Don't be rude,
but drink your drink quickly, say
goodbye, walk out the door, get in
your car, and go down the road.

LIVING ROOM

Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines
on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred
dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the
fat line.

CLOSEUP – MIA

Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels
like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong.
Then... the rush hits...

BATHROOM

Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his
dialogue with the mirror.

VINCENT
...It's a moral test of yourself,
whether or not you can maintain
loyalty. Because when people are
loyal to each other, that's very
meaningful.

LIVING ROOM

Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but
it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from
her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her
stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.

BATHROOM

Vince continues.

VINCENT
So you're gonna go out there, drink
your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had
a very lovely evening," go home, and
jack off. And that's all you're
gonna do.

Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's
ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of
that door. So he goes through it.

LIVING ROOM

We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to
the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like
a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are
down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the
tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her
face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open.
Slack-jawed.

VINCENT
Jesus Christ!

Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body.
Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck
to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.

Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.

VINCENT
(sounding weird)
Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?

But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles,
but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.

Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.

VINCENT
(to himself)
I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
(to Mia)
Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer
me honey, what did you take?

Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.

Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the
rack.

He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent
makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.

VINCENT
(yelling to Mia)
Okay honey, we're getting you on
your feet.

He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.

VINCENT
We're on our feet now, and now we're
gonna talk out to the car. Here we
go, watch us walk.

We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-
unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.

EXT. VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT

INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.

Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws,
speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.

INT.VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT

Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting
like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when
he glances over at Mia.

Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag
of water.

Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches
a number.

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant
drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.

He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-
out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT,
CALIFORNIA", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand
is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of
him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n
Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in
an ashtray.

On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three
Stooges, and they're getting married.

PREACHER (EMIL SIMKUS)
(on TV)
Hold hands, you love birds.

The phone RINGS.

Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.

It RINGS again.

Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.

JODY (O.S.)
Lance! The phone's ringing!

LANCE
(calling back)
I can hear it!

JODY (O.S.)
I thought you told those fuckin'
assholes never to call this late!

LANCE
(by the phone)
I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna
tell this fuckin' asshole right now!
(he answers the phone)
Hello, do you know how late it is?
You're not supposed to be callin' me
this fuckin' late.

BACK TO:

VINCENT IN THE MALIBU

Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching
the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the
conversation.

VINCENT
Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big
fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way
to your place.

LANCE
Whoa, hold you horses man, what's
the problem?

VINCENT
You still got an adrenaline shot?

LANCE
(dawning on him)
Maybe.

VINCENT
I need it man, I got a chick she's
fuckin' Doing on me.

LANCE
Don't bring her here! I'm not even
fuckin' joking with you, don't you
be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt
to my house!

VINCENT
No choice.

LANCE
She's ODin'?

VINCENT
Yeah. She's dyin'.

LANCE
Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take
'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!

VINCENT
Negative.

LANCE
She ain't my fuckin' problem, you
fucked her up, you deal with it –
are you talkin' to me on a cellular
phone?

VINCENT
Sorry.

LANCE
I don't know you, who is this, don't
come here, I'm hangin' up.

VINCENT
Too late, I'm already here.

At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu
coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his
curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH
in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn
and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out
of SHATTERS from the impact.

JODY (O.S.)
What the hell was that?

Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front
lawn.

EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia
out.

LANCE
Have you lost your mind?! You crashed
your car in my fuckin' house! You
talk about drug shit on a cellular
fuckin' phone –

VINCENT
If you're through havin' your little
hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get
your needle and git it now!

LANCE
Are you deaf? You're not bringin'
that fucked up bitch in my house!

VINCENT
This fucked up bitch is Marsellus
Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin'
croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But
before he turns me into a bar soap,
I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about
how you coulda saved her life, but
instead you let her die on your front
lawn.

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.

Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's
wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone
on it.

We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking
through the hall into the living room.

JODY
It's only one-thirty in the goddamn
mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on
out here?

As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance
standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of
the room.

From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a
DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference
here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.

JODY
Who's she?

Lance looks up at Jody.

LANCE
Get that black box in the bedroom I
have with the adrenaline shot.

JODY
What's wrong with her?

VINCENT
She's ODing on us.

JODY
Well get her the hell outta here!

LANCE AND VINCENT
(in stereo)
Get the fuckin' shot!

JODY
Don't yell and me!

She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking
for the shot.

WE MOVE into the room with the two men.

VINCENT
(to Lance)
You two are a match made in heaven.

LANCE
Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay?
While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta
get a medical book.

VINCENT
What do you need a medical book for?

LANCE
To tell me how to do it. I've never
given an adrenaline shot before.

VINCENT
You've had that thing for six years
and you never used it?

LANCE
I never had to use it. I don't go
joypoppin' with bubble-gummers, all
of my friends can handle their highs!

VINCENT
Well then get it.

LANCE
I am, if you'll let me.

VINCENT
I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.

LANCE
Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin'
to her.

WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a...

INT. SPARE ROOM

With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning
the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words,
"Come on," endlessly.

From OFF SCREEN we hear:

VINCENT (O.S.)
Hurry up man! We're losin' her!

LANCE
(calling back)
I'm looking as fast as I can!

Lance continues his frenzied search.

WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.

JODY (O.S.)
What's he lookin' for?

VINCENT (O.S.)
I dunno, some medical book.

Jody calls to LANCE.

JODY (O.S.)
What are you lookin' for?

LANCE
My black medical book!

As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit,
Jody appears in the doorway.

JODY
Whata're you looking for?

LANCE
My black fuckin' medical book. It's
like a text book they give to nurses.

JODY
I never saw a medical book.

LANCE
Trust me, I have one.

JODY
Well if it's that important, why
didn't you keep it with the shot?

Lance spins toward her.

LANCE
I don't know! Stop bothering me!

JODY
While you're lookin' for it, that
girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're
never gonna find it in all this shit.
For six months now, I've been telling
you to clean this room –

VINCENT (O.S.)
– get your ass in here, fuck the
book!

Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT
heading for the living room.

LIVING ROOM

Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance
reenters the room.

VINCENT
Quit fuckin' around man and give her
the shot!

Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He
opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.

LANCE
While I'm doing this, take her shirt
off and find her heart.

Vince rips her blouse open.

Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.

VINCENT
Does it have to be exact?

LANCE
Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving
her an injection in the heart, so I
gotta exactly hit her in the heart.

VINCENT
Well, I don't know exactly where her
heart is, I think it's here.

Vince points to Mia's right breast. Lance glances over and
nods.

LANCE
That's it.

As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.

VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, got
one?

JODY
What?

VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, any
felt pen'll do, but a magic marker
would be great.

JODY
Hold on.

Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her
enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents
of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.

The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.

LANCE
It's ready, I'll tell you what to
do.

VINCENT
You're gonna give her the shot.

LANCE
No, you're gonna give her the shot.

VINCENT
I've never does this before.

LANCE
I've never done this before either,
and I ain't starting now. You brought
'er here, that means you give her
the shot. The day I bring an ODing
bitch to your place, then I gotta
give her the shot.

Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic
marker in her hand.

JODY
Got it.

Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes
a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.

VINCENT
Okay, what do I do?

LANCE
Well, you're giving her an injection
of adrenaline straight to her heart.
But she's got a breast plate in front
of her heart, so you gotta pierce
through that. So what you gotta do
is bring the needle down in a stabbing
motion.

Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The
Shape" killing its victims in "HALLOWEEN".

VINCENT
I gotta stab her?

LANCE
If you want the needle to pierce
through to her heart, you gotta stab
her hard.

Then once you do, push down on the plunger.

VINCENT
What happens after that?

LANCE
I'm curious about that myself.

VINCENT
This ain't a fuckin' joke man!

LANCE
She's supposed to come out of it
like –
(snaps his fingers)
– that.

Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing
motion.

He looks down on Mia.

Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.

Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.

VINCENT
Count to three.

Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know
what to expect.

LANCE
One...

RED DOT on Mia's body.

Needle raised ready to strike.

LANCE (O.S.)
...two...

Jody's face is alive with anticipation.

NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.

LANCE (O.S.)
...three!

The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.

Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the
chest.

Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.

The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline
out through the needle.

Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of
the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck
in her chest – SCREAMING.

Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in
front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.

Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of
air.

The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken
to their bones, look to see if she's alright.

LANCE
If you're okay, say something.

Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a
relatively normal voice.

MIA
Something.

Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and
shaking from how close to death Mia came.

JODY
Anybody want a beer?

CUT TO:

INT. VINCENT'S MALIBU (MOVING) – NIGHT

Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says
anything, both are still too shaken.

EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying
a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway
toward her front door.

VINCENT (O.S.)
Mia!

She turns around.

Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big
distance between the two.

VINCENT
What are your thoughts on how to
handle this?

MIA
What's yours?

VINCENT
Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus
can live his whole live and never
ever hear of this incident.

Mia smiles.

MIA
Don't worry about it. If Marsellus
ever heard of this, I'd be in as
much trouble as you.

VINCENT
I seriously doubt that.

MIA
If you can keep a secret, so can I.

VINCENT
Let's shake on it.

The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to
shake and shake they do.

VINCENT
Mum's the word.

Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-
evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.

Vincent smiles.

VINCENT
If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home
and have a heart attack.

Mia giggles.

Vincent turns to leave.

MIA
You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE
FIVE" joke?

Vincent turns around.

VINCENT
Sure, but I think I'm still a little
too petrified to laugh.

MIA
Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's
not funny. But if you still wanna
hear it, I'll tell it.

VINCENT
I can't wait.

MIA
Three tomatoes are walking down the
street, a poppa tomato, a momma
tomato, and a little baby tomato.
The baby tomato is lagging behind
the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa
tomato gets mad, goes over to the
momma tomato and stamps on him –
(stamps on the ground)
– and says: catch up.

They both smile, but neither laugh.

MIA
See ya 'round, Vince.

Mia turns and walks inside her house.

CLOSEUP – VINCENT

After Mia walks inside. Vincent continues to look at where
she was. He brings his hands to his lips and blows her a
kiss. Then exits FRAME leaving it empty. WE HEAR his Malibu
START UP and DRIVE AWAY.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP On the cartoon "SPEED RACER." Speed is giving a
detailed description of all the features on his race car
"The Mac-5," which he does at the beginning of every episode.

OFF SCREEN we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE... .

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Butch.

DISSOLVE TO:

BUTCH'S POV

We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in
Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish,
stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to
her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force
officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old
boy.

MOTHER
Butch, stop watching TV a second. We
got a special visitor. Now do you
remember when I told you your daddy
dies in a P.O.W. camp?

BUTCH (O.S.)
Uh-huh.

MOTHER
Well this here is Capt. Koons. He
was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and
bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's
eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas
accent.

CAPT. KOONS
Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard
a bunch about you. See, I was a good
friend of your Daddy's. We were in
that Hanoi pit of hell over five
years together. Hopefully, you'll
never have to experience this
yourself, but when two men are in a
situation like me and your Daddy
were, for as long as we were, you
take on certain responsibilities of
the other. If it had been me who had
not made it, Major Coolidge would be
talkin' right now to my son Jim. But
the way it worked out is I'm talkin'
to you, Butch. I got somethin' for
ya.

The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.

CAPT. KOONS
This watch I got here was first
purchased by your great-granddaddy.
It was bought during the First World
War in a little general store in
Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought
by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge
the day he set sail for Paris. It
was your great-granddaddy's war watch,
made by the first company to ever
make wrist watches. You see, up until
then, people just carried pocket
watches. Your great-granddaddy wore
that watch every day he was in the
war. Then when he had done his duty,
he went home to your great-
grandmother, took the watch off his
wrist and put it in an ol' coffee
can. And in that can it stayed 'til
your grandfather Dane Coolidge was
called upon by his country to go
overseas and fight the Germans once
again. This time they called it World
War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave
it to your granddad for good luck.
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as
good as his old man's. Your granddad
was a Marine and he was killed with
all the other Marines at the battle
of Wake Island. Your granddad was
facing death and he knew it. None of
those boys had any illusions about
ever leavin' that island alive. So
three days before the Japanese took
the island, your 22-year old
grandfather asked a gunner on an Air
Force transport named Winocki, a man
he had never met before in his life,
to deliver to his infant son, who he
had never seen in the flesh, his
gold watch. Three days later, your
grandfather was dead. But Winocki
kept his word. After the war was
over, he paid a visit to your
grandmother, delivering to your infant
father, his Dad's gold watch. This
watch. This watch was on your Daddy's
wrist when he was shot down over
Hanoi. He was captured and put in a
Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew
if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd
be confiscated. The way your Daddy
looked at it, that watch was your
birthright. And he'd be damned if
and slopeheads were gonna put their
greasy yella hands on his boy's
birthright. So he hid it in the one
place he knew he could hide somethin'.
His ass. Five long years, he wore
this watch up his ass. Then when he
died of dysentery, he gave me the
watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass for two years.
Then, after seven years, I was sent
home to my family. And now, little
man, I give the watch to you.

Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes
into FRAME to accept it.

CUT TO:

INT. LOCKER ROOM – NIGHT

The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia:
trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few
zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to
him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory,
he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.

His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a
little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to
be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.

KLONDIKE
It's time, Butch.

BUTCH
I'm ready.

Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB
outside.

He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch
hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him
on with the robe, which says on the back: "BATTLING BUTCH
COOLIDGE".

The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for
Butch.

As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit.
Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet,
empty locker room.

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE CARD:

"THE GOLD WATCH"

We hear over the black and white title:

– Well Dan, that had to be the
bloodiest and, hands-down, the most
brutal fight this city has ever seen.

The SOUND of chaos in the b.g.

FADE IN:

EXT. ALLEY (RAINING) – NIGHT

A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. The
sky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked
car. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from
inside.

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
...Coolidge was out of there faster
than I've ever seen a victorious
boxer vacate the ring. Do you think
he knew Willis was dead?

SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
My guess would be yes, Richard. I
could see from my position here, the
frenzy in his eyes give way to the
realization of what he was doing. I
think any man would've left the ring
that fast.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TAXI (PARKED/RAINING) – NIGHT

Inside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named
ESMARELDA VILLALOBOS. A young woman, with Spanish looks,
sits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a
white styrofoam cup.

The Sportscasters continue their coverage.

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
Do you feel this ring death tragedy
will have an effect on the world of
boxing?

SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't
help but shake the world of boxing
to its very foundation. But it's of
paramount importance that during the
sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the
W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the –

CLICK – Esmarelda shuts off the radio.

She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in
the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:

EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT

A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-
side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage
dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed
in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to
the dumpster below.

ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.

Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS
to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and
throws it to the ground.

INT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING) – NIGHT

Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves,
HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.

Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through
the rearview mirror:

ESMARELDA
(Spanish accent)
Are you the man I was supposed to
pick up?

BUTCH
If you're the cab I called, I'm the
guy you're supposed to pick up.

ESMARELDA
Where to?

BUTCH
Outta here.

The ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life.

The meter is FLIPPED on.

Esmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal.

EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT

The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet
pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.

INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM) – NIGHT

Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through
the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall,
shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave
takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by
the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.

VINCENT
Mia. How you doin'?

MIA
Great. I never thanked you for the
dinner.

In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table –
dead.

His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is
on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.

The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table,
hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support.
We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.

Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.

Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
What'cha got?

ENGLISH DAVE
He booked.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
I'm prepared to scour the earth for
this motherfucker. If Butch goes to
Indo China, I want a nigger hidin'
in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a
cap in his ass.

ENGLISH DAVE
I'll take care of it.

INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) – NIGHT

Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.

Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.

He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't
find the roll bar.

BUTCH
Hey, how do I open the window back
here?

ESMARELDA
I have to do it.

She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch
tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying
the other one.

Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.

ESMARELDA
Hey, mister?

BUTCH
(still working on the
glove)
What?

ESMARELDA
You were in that fight? The fight on
the radio – you're the fighter?

As he tosses his other glove out the window.

BUTCH
Whatever gave you that idea?

ESMARELDA
No c'mon, you're him, I know you're
him, tell me you're him.

BUTCH
(drying himself with
a gym towel)
I'm him.

ESMARELDA
You killed the other boxing man.

BUTCH
He's dead?

ESMARELDA
The radio said he was dead.

He finished wiping himself down.

BUTCH
(to himself)
Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.

He tosses the towel out the window.

Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.

ESMARELDA
What does it feel like?

BUTCH
(finds his shirt)
What does what feel like?

ESMARELDA
Killing a man. Beating another man
to death with your bare hands.

Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.

BUTCH
Are you some kinda weirdo?

ESMARELDA
No, it's a subject I have much
interest in. You are the first person
I ever met who has killed somebody.
So, what was it like to kill a man?

BUTCH
Tell ya what, you give me one of
them cigarettes, I'll give you an
answer.

Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement.

ESMARELDA
Deal!

Butch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road,
passes a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not
looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in
it.

Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.

He takes a long drag.

BUTCH
So...

He looks at her license.

BUTCH
...Esmarelda Villalobos – is that
Mexican?

ESMARELDA
The name is Spanish, but I'm
Columbian.

BUTCH
It's a very pretty name.

ESMARELDA
It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."

BUTCH
That's one hell of a name you got
there, sister.

ESMARELDA
Thank you. And what is your name?

BUTCH
Butch.

ESMARELDA
Butch. What does it mean?

BUTCH
I'm an American, our names don't
mean shit. Anyway, moving right along,
what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?

ESMARELDA
I want to know what it feels like to
kill a man –

BUTCH
– I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know
he was dead 'til you told me he was
dead. Now I know he's dead, do you
wanna know how I feel about it?

Esmarelda nods her head: "yes."

BUTCH
I don't feel the least little bit
bad.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING) – NIGHT

We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.

BUTCH
(into phone)
What'd I tell ya, soon as the word
got out a fix was in, the odds would
be outta control. Hey, if he was a
better fighter he's be alive. If he
never laced up his gloves in the
first place, which he never shoulda
done, he'd be alive. Enough about
the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's
talk about the rich and prosperous
Mr. Butch. How many bookies you
spread it around with?

(PAUSE)
Eight? How long to collect?
(pause)
So by tomorrow evening, you'll have
it all?
(pause)
Good news Scotty, real good news – I
understand a few stragglers aside.
Me an' Fabienne're gonna leave in
the morning. It should take us a
couple days to get into Knoxville.
Next time we see each other, it'll
be on Tennessee time.

Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to
take him wherever he wants to go.

BUTCH
(to himself in French
with English subtitles)
Fabienne my love, our adventure
begins.

CUT TO:

EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) – NIGHT

Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain
has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out,
now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic
jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.

ESMARELDA
Forty-five sixty.

Handing her the money.

BUTCH
Merci beaucoup. And here's a little
something for the effort.

Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.

Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds
it out of reach.

BUTCH
Now if anybody should ask you about
who your fare was tonight, what're
you gonna tell 'em?

ESMARELDA
The truth. Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted, Mexicans.

He gives her the bill.

BUTCH
Bon soir, Esmarelda.

ESMARELDA
(in Spanish)
Sleep well, Butch.

He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away.
She drives off.

INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT

Butch enters and turns on the light.

Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to
us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.

FABIENNE
Keep the light off.

Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.

BUTCH
Is that better, sugar pop?

FABIENNE
Oui. Hard day at the office?

BUTCH
Pretty hard. I got into a fight.

FABIENNE
Poor baby. Can we make spoons?

Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.

When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in
babytalk.

FABIENNE
I was looking at myself in the mirror.

BUTCH
Uh-huh?

FABIENNE
I wish I had a pot.

BUTCH
You were lookin' in the mirror and
you wish you had some pot?

FABIENNE
A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are
sexy.

BUTCH
Well you should be happy, 'cause you
do.

FABIENNE
Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot!
I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna
when she did "Lucky Star," it's not
the same thing.

BUTCH
I didn't realize there was a
difference between a tummy and a pot
belly.

FABIENNE
The difference is huge.

BUTCH
You want me to have a pot?

FABIENNE
No. Pot bellies make a man look either
oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a
woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The
rest of you is normal. Normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal
ass, but with a big, perfectly round
pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a
tee-shirt two sizes too small to
accentuate it.

BUTCH
You think guys would find that
attractive?

FABIENNE
I don't give a damn what men find
attractive. It's unfortunate what we
find pleasing to the touch and
pleasing to the eye is seldom the
same.

BUTCH
If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in
it.

FABIENNE
You'd punch me in my belly?

BUTCH
Right in the belly.

FABIENNE
I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your
right on your face 'til you couldn't
breathe.

BUTCH
You'd do that to me?

FABIENNE
Yes!

BUTCH
Did you get everything, sugar pop?

FABIENNE
Yes, I did.

BUTCH
Good job.

FABIENNE
Did everything go as planned?

BUTCH
You didn't listen to the radio?

FABIENNE
I never listen to your fights. Were
you the winner?

BUTCH
I won alright.

FABIENNE
Are you still retiring?

BUTCH
Sure am.

FABIENNE
What about the man you fought?

BUTCH
Floyd retired too.

FABIENNE
(smiling)
Really?! He won't be fighting no
more?!

BUTCH
Not no more.

FABIENNE
So it all worked out in the finish?

BUTCH
We ain't at the finish, baby.

Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.

FABIENNE
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

Butch nods his head: "yes."

FABIENNE
If they find us, they'll kill us,
won't they?

Butch nods his head: "yes."

FABIENNE
But they won't find us, will they?

Butch nods his head: "no."

FABIENNE
Do you still want me to go with you?

Butch nods his head: "yes."

FABIENNE
I don't want to be a burden or a
nuisance -

Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her
crotch.

Fabienne reacts.

FABIENNE
Say it!

BUTCH
Fabienne, I want you to be with me.

FABIENNE
Forever?

BUTCH
...and ever.

Fabienne lies her head back.

Butch continues to massage her crotch.

FABIENNE
Do you love me?

BUTCH
Oui.

FABIENNE
Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?

Butch kisses her on the mouth.

BUTCH
Will you kiss it?

She nods her head: "yes."

FABIENNE
But you first.

Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral
pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.

FABIENNE
(in French, with
English subtitles)
Butch my love, the adventure begins.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

MOTEL ROOM

Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in
the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We
see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow
her up.

She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower
washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the
smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom.
Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his
head out.

BUTCH
I think I cracked a rib.

FABIENNE
Giving me oral pleasure?

BUTCH
No retard, from the fight.

FABIENNE
Don't call me retard.

BUTCH
(in a Mongoloid voice)
My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!

FABIENNE
Shut up fuck head! I hate that
Mongoloid voice.

BUTCH
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it
back! Can I have a towel please,
Miss Beautiful Tulip.

FABIENNE
Oh I like that, I like being called
a tulip. Tulip is much better than
Mongoloid.

She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban
on her head.

BUTCH
I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I
called you a retard, but I took it
back.

She hands him a towel.

BUTCH
Merci beaucoup.

FABIENNE
Butch?

BUTCH
(drying his head)
Yes, lemon pie.

FABIENNE
Where are we going to go?

BUTCH
I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want.
We're gonna get a lot of money from
this. But it ain't gonna be so much,
we can live like hogs in the fat
house forever. I was thinking we
could go somewhere in the South
Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll
carry us a long way down there.

FABIENNE
So if we wanted, we could live in
Bora Bora?

BUTCH
You betcha. And if after awhile you
don't dig Bora Bora, then we can
move over to Tahiti or Mexico.

FABIENNE
But I do not speak Spanish.

BUTCH
You don't speak Bora Boran either.
Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta
el zapataria?

FABIENNE
What does that mean?

BUTCH
Where's the shoe store?

FABIENNE
Donde esta el zapataria?

BUTCH
Excellent pronunciation. You'll be
my little mama ceta in no time.

Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes
her teeth.

Butch keeps on from the other room.

BUTCH (O.S.)
Que hora es?

FABIENNE
Que hora es?

BUTCH (O.S.)
What time is it?

FABIENNE
What time is it?

BUTCH (O.S.)
Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.

Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or
two, then she remember something.

FABIENNE
Butch.

She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only
to find him sound asleep in bed.

She looks at him for a moment.

FABIENNE
Forget it.

She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the
WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

MOTEL ROOM – MORNING

SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still
asleep in bed.

Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the
bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still
wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.

ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking
on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS".

Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing
him.

His start startles Fabienne.

FABIENNE
Merde! You startled me. Did you have
a bad dream?

Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to
focus.

Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV
Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.

BUTCH
What are you watching?

FABIENNE
A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the
name.

BUTCH
Are you watchin' it?

Fabienne enters the room.

FABIENNE
In a way. Why? Would you like for me
to switch it off?

BUTCH
Would you please?

She reaches over and turns off the TV.

BUTCH
It's a little too early in the morning
for explosions and war.

FABIENNE
What was it about?

BUTCH
How should I know, you were the one
watchin' it.

Fabienne laughs.

FABIENNE
No, imbecile, what was your dream
about?

BUTCH
Oh, I... don't remember. It's really
rare I remember a dream.

FABIENNE
You just woke up from it.

BUTCH
Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I
don't remember.

FABIENNE
Well, let's look at the grumpy man
in the morning. I didn't say you
were lying, it's just odd you don't
remember your dreams. I always
remember mine. Did you know you talk
in your sleep?

BUTCH
I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk
in my sleep?

FABIENNE
You did last night.

BUTCH
What did I say?

Laying on top of him.

FABIENNE
I don't know. I couldn't understand
you.

She kisses Butch.

FABIENNE
Why don't you get up and we'll get
some breakfast at that breakfast
place with the pancakes.

BUTCH
One more kiss and I'll get up.

Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.

FABIENNE
Satisfied?

BUTCH
Yep.

FABIENNE
Then get up, lazy bones.

Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of
the suitcase that Fabienne brought.

BUTCH
What time is it?

FABIENNE
Almost nine in the morning. What
time does our train arrive?

BUTCH
Eleven.

FABIENNE
I'm gonna order a big plate of
blueberry pancakes with maple syrup,
eggs over easy, and five sausages.

BUTCH
(surprised at her
potential appetite)
Anything to drink with that?

Butch is finished dressing.

FABIENNE
(referring to his
clothes)
Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a
tall glass or orange juice and a
black cup of coffee. After that, I'm
going to have a slice of pie.

As he goes through the suitcase.

BUTCH
Pie for breakfast?

FABIENNE
Any time of the day is a good time
for pie. Blueberry pie to go with
the pancakes. And on top, a thin
slice of melted cheese –

BUTCH
– where's my watch?

FABIENNE
It's there.

BUTCH
No, it's not. It's not here.

FABIENNE
Have you looked?

By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.

BUTCH
Yes I've fuckin' looked!!

He's now throwing clothes.

BUTCH
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?!
Are you sure you got it?

Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.

FABIENNE
Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer
–

BUTCH
– on the little kangaroo.

FABIENNE
Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.

BUTCH
Well it's not here!

FABIENNE
(on the verge of tears)
Well it should be!

BUTCH
Oh it most definitely should be here,
but it's not. So where is it?

Fabienne is crying and scared.

Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more
menacing.

BUTCH
Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin'
watch. You know what my father went
through to git me that watch?... I
don't wanna get into it right now...
but he went through a lot. Now all
this other shit, you coulda set on
fire, but I specifically reminded
you not to forget my father's watch.
Now think, did you get it?

FABIENNE
I believe so...

BUTCH
You believe so? You either did, or
you didn't, now which one is it?

FABIENNE
Then I did.

BUTCH
Are you sure?

FABIENNE
(shaking)
No.

Butch freaks out, he punches the air.

Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the
motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.

Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.

Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.

BUTCH
(to Fabienne)
No! It's not your fault.
(he approached her)
You left it at the apartment.

He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.

He touches her hand, she flinches.

BUTCH
If you did leave it at the apartment,
it's not your fault. I had you bring
a bunch of stuff. I reminded you
about it, but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me. If
all I gave a fuck about was my watch,
I should've told you. You ain't a
mind reader.

He kisses her hand. Then rises.

Fabienne is still sniffling.

Butch goes to the closet.

FABIENNE
I'm sorry.

Butch puts on his high school jacket.

BUTCH
Don't be. It just means I won't be
able to eat breakfast with you.

FABIENNE
Why does it mean that?

BUTCH
Because I'm going back to my apartment
to get my watch.

FABIENNE
Won't the gangsters be looking for
you there?

BUTCH
That's what I'm gonna find out. If
they are, and I don't think I can
handle it, I'll split.

Rising from the floor.

FABIENNE
I was so dreadful. I saw your watch,
I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.

BUTCH
Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing
you could ever do would make me
permanently angry at you.
(pause)
I love you, remember?
(he digs some money
out of his wallet)
Now here's some money, order those
pancakes and have a great breakfast.

FABIENNE
Don't go.

BUTCH
I'll be back before you can say,
blueberry pie.

FABIENNE
Blueberry pie.

BUTCH
Well maybe not that fast, but fast.
Okay? Okay?

FABIENNE
Okay.

He kisses her once more and heads for the door.

BUTCH
Bye-bye, sugar pop.

FABIENNE
Bye.

BUTCH
I'm gonna take your Honda.

FABIENNE
Okay.

And with that, he's out the door.

Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.

INT. HONDA (MOVING) – DAY

Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his
fists as he drives down the street.

BUTCH
Of all the fuckin' things she coulda
forgot, she forgets my father's watch.
I specifically reminded her not to
forget it. "Bedside table – on the
kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't
forget my father's watch."

EXT. CITY STREET – DAY

The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is
little engine will take it.

CUT TO:

A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the
arrow pointing at one hour.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER – DAY

Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a
couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before
he goes boppin' through the front door.

EXT. ALLEY – DAY

Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street,
then he discreetly glances out.

EXT. STREET – BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY

Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of
cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of
place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.
Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of
Butch's home.

Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.

Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He
crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.

Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a
combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign
sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a
graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.

EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY

Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment
building. Once again, everything appears normal – the laundry
room, the pool, his apartment door – nothing appears
disturbed.

Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12.
He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.

Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening
it.

INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY

His apartment hasn't been touched.

He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick
look around. Obviously, no one is there.

Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the
refrigerator.

He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.

With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he
goes to the bedroom.

His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment – neat, clean
and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a
few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue
of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of
Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.

Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On
the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.

He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He
opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting
down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and
puts them in the toaster.

Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.

What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun
with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.

BUTCH
(softly)
Holy shit.

He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines
it.

Then... a toilet FLUSHES.

Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to
the kitchen. There is someone behind it.

Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not
knowing what to do.

The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the
bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book
"MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.

Vincent and Butch lock eyes.

Vincent freezes.

Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's
direction.

Neither man opens his mouth.

Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.

That's all the situation needed.

Butch's finger HITS the trigger.

MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.

Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets
SIMULTANEOUSLY – LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him
through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door
at the end of the bathroom.

By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent
is annihilated.

Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look
goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once
Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.

With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61
back on the kitchen counter.

Then he exits the apartment, quickly.

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY

Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the
courtyard...

...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...

...goes through the alley...

...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.

EXT. HONDA – DAY

Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide
smile of a survivor breaks across his face.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET – DAY

The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his
apartment building.

INT. HONDA – DAY

Butch looks out the window at his former home.

BUTCH
That's how you're gonna beat 'em,
Butch. They keep underestimatin'
ya.

This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips
a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he
SINGS along with it.

He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on
the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.

Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we
see:

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut,
carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam
cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street
in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see
Marsellus clearly.

Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front
of him.

When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances
to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!

DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"

Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question.
He STOMPS on the gas pedal.

The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts
and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.

Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold
Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending
it up on the sidewalk.

Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what
at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his
nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play.
A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.

PEDESTRIAN
Jesus, are you okay?

Butch look at him, spaced-out.

BUTCH
I guess.

Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS
gather around the body.

GAWKER #1
(to the others)
He's dead! He's dead!

This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.

TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.

The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.

GAWKER #2
If you need a witness in court, I'll
be glad to help. He was a drunken
maniac. He hit you and crashed into
that car.

MARSELLUS
(still incoherent)
Who?

GAWKER #2
(pointing at Butch)
Him.

Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge
down the street, looking a shambles.

MARSELLUS
Well, I'll be damned.

The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back
away.

Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.

Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward
him.

BUTCH
Sacre bleu.

Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt,
shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.

He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground,
screaming.

LOOKY-LOO WOMAN
Oh my God, I've been shot!

That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.

Marsellus RUNS after him.

The CROWD looks agape.

Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.

The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.

Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a
sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP".

INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY

MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter
of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of
Butch RACES into his world.

MAYNARD
Can I help you wit' somethin'?

BUTCH
Shut up!

Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands
next to the door.

MAYNARD
Now you just wait one goddamn minute
–

Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in.
He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist
in Marsellus' face.

The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man
FALLS FLAT on his back.

Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.

Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in
the face.

Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold
of his middle finger.

BUTCH
So you like chasing people, huh?

He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound. Butch
then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS
back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to
shield the splatter.

BUTCH
Well guess what, big man, you caught
me –

MAYNARD (O.S.)
– hold it right there, godammit!

Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a
pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.

BUTCH
Look mister, this ain't any of your
business –

MAYNARD
– I'm makin' it my business! Now
toss that gun!

Butch does.

MAYNARD
Now you on top, stand up and come to
the counter.

Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he
gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face
with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.

After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on
the counter and moves to the telephone.

Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily
watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on
the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.

MAYNARD
Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just
caught a coupl'a flies.

Marsellus passes out.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY

TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are
two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and
a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are
unconscious.

Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both
guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two
prisoners look up at their captors.

Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one
hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in
his belt.

MAYNARD
Nobody kills anybody in my place of
business except me or Zed.

A BUZZER buzzes.

MAYNARD
That's Zed.

Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs
that lead to red curtains and goes through them.

WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed
inside the store.

Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of
the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking
in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other,
all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both
share at what they've gotten themselves into.

Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even
more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible.
The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is
a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and
stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a
long time, then says:

ZED
(to Maynard)
You said you waited for me?

MAYNARD
I did.

ZED
Then how come they're all beat up?

MAYNARD
They did that to each other. They
was fightin' when they came in. This
one was gonna shoot that one.

ZED
(to Butch)
You were gonna shoot him?

Butch makes no reply.

ZED
Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front
of this place?

MAYNARD
Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?

ZED
No, it's Thursday.

MAYNARD
Then she'll be fine.

ZED
Bring out The Gimp.

MAYNARD
I think The Gimp's sleepin'.

ZED
Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em
up then, won't you?

Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.

MAYNARD
(yelling in the hole)
Wake up!

Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a
leash.

He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises
THE GIMP.

The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black
leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs
here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather
mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth.
They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large
dog.

Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners,
then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed,
then backs away.

MAYNARD
(to The Gimp)
Down!

The Gimp gets on its knees.

Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.

MAYNARD
Who's first?

ZED
I ain't fer sure yet.

Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany,
miney, moe... " just his mouth mouthing the words and his
finger going back and forth between the two.

Butch are Marsellus are terrified.

Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.

The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.

Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving
left to right, then it stops.

TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on
Marsellus.

Zed stands up.

ZED
Wanna do it here?

MAYNARD
Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old
room.

Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old
room.

Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the
misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop.
Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and
Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the
back room, is empty.

As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before
he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.

MAYNARD
(to The Gimp)
Up!

The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on
the ceiling.

MAYNARD
Keep an eye on this one.

The Gimp bows its head: "yes." Maynard disappears into
Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because
suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.

Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath
the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history
of comedy.

From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:

MAYNARD (O.S.)
Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight
in 'em!

We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.

ZED (O.S.)
You wanna fight? You wanna fight?
Good, I like to fight!

Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic,
hurriedly struggles to get free.

The Gimp is laughing wildly.

The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.

The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:

MAYNARD (O.S.)
That's it... that's it boy, you're
goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like
that... that's good.
(grunting faster)
Stay still... stay still goddamn ya!
Zed goddammit, git over here and
hold 'em!

Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite
easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it
were never connected by a bolt.

The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.

THE GIMP
Huhng?

The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook.
He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles
and grunts.

Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S
PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making
him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash
attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then
silently makes his way through the red curtains.

INT. PAWNSHOP – DAY

Butch sneaks to the door.

On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected
to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he
stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their
way with Marsellus.

Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in
a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the
pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in
with.

He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards
it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks
about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large
Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots
what he's been looking for:

A Samurai sword.

It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the
wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign.
Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its
sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten
in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his
thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not
on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems
made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the
sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears
through the red curtains to take care of business.

INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY

Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.

Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind
the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.

INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM – DAY

Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It
swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched
positions.

Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden
horse.

Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.

Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up
behind him with the sword.

Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus,
red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see
Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.

BUTCH
Hey hillbilly.

Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.

Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across
the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on
Zed.

Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.

Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword
behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing
the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.

Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go
from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic,
which lies within reach.

Butch's eyes follow Zed's.

BUTCH
You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.

Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.

Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.

Zed studies Butch.

Butch looks hard at Zed.

Then a VOICE says:

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Step aside, Butch.

Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him,
holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.

KABOOM!!!!

Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.

Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the
used shotgun shell.

Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:

BUTCH
You okay?

MARSELLUS
Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from
okay!

Long pause.

BUTCH
What now?

MARSELLUS
What now? Well let me tell you what
now. I'm gonna call a couple pipe-
hittin' niggers, who'll go to work
on homes here with a pair of pliers
and a blow torch.
(to Zed)
Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I
ain't through with you by a damn
sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on
your ass.

BUTCH
I meant what now, between me and
you?

MARSELLUS
Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell
ya what now between me an' you. There
is no me an' you. Not no more.

BUTCH
So we're cool?

MARSELLUS
Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I
ask – two things I ask: Don't tell
nobody about this. This shit's between
me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-
the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-
agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It
ain't nobody else's business. Two:
leave town. Tonight. Right now. And
when you're gone, stay gone. You've
lost your Los Angeles privileges.
Deal?

BUTCH
Deal.

The two men shake hands, then hug one another.

MARSELLUS
Go on now, get your ass outta here.

Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.

Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.

MARSELLUS
(into the phone)
Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta
bit of a situation.

EXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY

Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He
looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment,
Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has
the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys
with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES
to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit.
Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.

WE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...

INT. BUTCH AND FABIENNE'S HOTEL ROOM – DAY

Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a "Frankie says,
Relax" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a
BOOM BOX.

EXT. CITY STREET – CHOPPER (MOVING) – DAY

Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named "GRACE."
He checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.

The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.

EXT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the
motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.

FABIENNE (O.S.)
Butch, I was so worried!

BUTCH
Honey, grab your radio and your purse
and let's go!

FABIENNE (O.S.)
But what about all our bags?

BUTCH
Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train
if we don't split now.

FABIENNE (O.S.)
Is everything well? Are we in danger?

BUTCH
We're cool. In fact, we're super-
cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait
for you outside.

Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the
motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she
sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.

FABIENNE
Where did you get this motorcycle?

BUTCH
(he kick-starts it)
It's a chopper, baby, hop on.

Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.

FABIENNE
What happened to my Honda?

BUTCH
Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.

FABIENNE
You're hurt?

BUTCH
I might've broke my nose, no biggie.
Hop on.

She doesn't move.

Butch looks at her.

BUTCH
Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!

Fabienne starts to cry.

Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the
bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her
hand.

BUTCH
I'm sorry, baby-love.

FABIENNE
(crying)
You were gone so long, I started to
think dreadful thoughts.

BUTCH
I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.
Everything's fine. Hey, how was
breakfast?

FABIENNE
(waterworks drying a
little)
It was good –

BUTCH
– did you get the blueberry pancakes?

FABIENNE
No, they didn't have blueberry
pancakes, I had to get buttermilk –
are you sure you're okay?

BUTCH
Baby-love, from the moment I left
you, this has been without a doubt
the single weirdest day of my entire
life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about
it.

Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up.

FABIENNE
Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

BUTCH
It's a chopper.

FABIENNE
Whose chopper is this?

BUTCH
Zed's.

FABIENNE
Who's Zed?

BUTCH
Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.

And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the
SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE CARD:

"JULES VINCENT JIMMIE & THE WOLF"

TITLE DISAPPEARS.

Over black, we can HEAR in the distance, men talking.

JULES (O.S.)
You ever read the Bible, Brett?

BRETT (O.S.)
Yes!

JULES (O.S.)
There's a passage I got memorized,
seems appropriate for this situation:
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men..."

FADE UP:

INT. BATHROOM – DAY

We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in
earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except
this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The
Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard
to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly
CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.

JULES (O.S.)
"...blessed is he who, in the name
of charity and good will, shepherded
the weak through the valley of
darkness. And I will strike down
upon thee with great vengeance and
furious anger those who attempt to
poison and destroy my brothers. And
you will know I am the Lord when I
lay my vengeance upon you."

BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!

The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the
back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow
fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough
to stick their head through that door.

Then he listens to them talk.

VINCENT (O.S.)
Friend of yours?

JULES (O.S.)
Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.

Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the
door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around
is the way to go.

INT. APARTMENT – DAY

The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES
out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his
hand cannon.

FOURTH MAN
Die... die... die... die...!

DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.

He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion
crosses his face.

TWO SHOT – JULES AND VINCENT

Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems,
none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody.
Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit?" They're
as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other,
they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.

FOURTH MAN
I don't understand –

The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's
bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.

The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits
down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs
it off.

Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.

VINCENT
Why the fuck didn't you tell us about
that guy in the bathroom? Slip your
mind? Forget he was in there with a
goddamn hand cannon?

JULES
(to himself)
We should be fuckin' dead right now.
(pause)
Did you see that gun he fired at us?
It was bigger than him.

VINCENT
.357.

JULES
We should be fuckin' dead!

VINCENT
Yeah, we were lucky.

Jules rises, moving toward Vincent.

JULES
That shit wasn't luck. That shit was
somethin' else.

Vincent prepares to leave.

VINCENT
Yeah, maybe.

JULES
That was... divine intervention. You
know what divine intervention is?

VINCENT
Yeah, I think so. That means God
came down from Heaven and stopped
the bullets.

JULES
Yeah, man, that's what is means.
That's exactly what it means! God
came down from Heaven and stopped
the bullets.

VINCENT
I think we should be going now.

JULES
Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do
that! Don't blow this shit off!
What just happened was a fuckin'
miracle!

VINCENT
Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit
happens.

JULES
Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just
happen.

VINCENT
Do you wanna continue this theological
discussion in the car, or at the
jailhouse with the cops?

JULES
We should be fuckin' dead now, my
friend! We just witnessed a miracle,
and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge
it!

VINCENT
Okay man, it was a miracle, can we
leave now?

EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING – MORNING

The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic.

INT. NOVA (MOVING) – MORNING

Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and
Marvin in the back.

VINCENT
...Ever seen that show "COPS?" I
was watchin' it once and this cop
was on it who was talkin' about this
time he got into this gun fight with
a guy in a hallway. He unloads on
this guy and he doesn't hit anything.
And these guys were in a hallway.
It's a freak, but it happens.

JULES
If you wanna play blind man, then go
walk with a Shepherd. But me, my
eyes are wide fuckin' open.

VINCENT
What the fuck does that mean?

JULES
That's it for me. For here on in,
you can consider my ass retired.

VINCENT
Jesus Christ!

JULES
Don't blaspheme!

VINCENT
Goddammit, Jules –

JULES
– I said don't do that –

VINCENT
– you're fuckin' freakin' out!

JULES
I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm
through.

VINCENT
While you're at it, be sure to tell
'im why.

JULES
Don't worry, I will.

VINCENT
I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he
laughs his ass off.

JULES
I don't give a damn if he does.

Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his
grip.

VINCENT
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

MARVIN
I don't even have an opinion.

VINCENT
C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came
down from Heaven and stopped the
bullets?

Vincent's .45 goes BANG!

Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES
blood and SHAKES.

JULES
What the fuck's happening?

VINCENT
I just accidentally shot Marvin in
the throat.

JULES
Why the fuck did you do that?

VINCENT
I didn't mean to do it. I said it
was an accident.

JULES
I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in
my time –

VINCENT
– chill out, man, it was an accident,
okay? You hit a bump or somethin'
and the gun went off.

JULES
The car didn't hit no motherfuckin'
bump!

VINCENT
Look! I didn't mean to shoot this
son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went
off, don't ask me how!

JULES
Look at this mess! We're drivin'
around on a city street in broad
daylight –

VINCENT
– I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin'
about the splatter.

JULES
Well you better be thinkin' about it
now, motherfucker! We gotta get this
car off the road. Cops tend to notice
shit like you're driving a car
drenched in fuckin' blood.

VINCENT
Can't we just take it to a friendly
place?

JULES
This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus
don't got no friendly places in the
Valley.

VINCENT
Well, don't look at me, this is your
town, Jules.

Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits.

VINCENT
Who ya callin'?

JULES
A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.

VINCENT
Where's Toluca Lake.

JULES
On the other side of the hill, by
Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass
ain't home, I don't know what the
fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any
other partners in 818.
(into phone)
Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules.
(pause)
Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are
in some serious shit. We're in a car
we gotta get off the road, pronto! I
need to use your garage for a couple
hours.

INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM – DAY

Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while
Vincent stands behind him.

JULES
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie's situation. He's
one remark away from kickin' our
asses out the door.

VINCENT
If he kicks us out, whadda we do?

JULES
Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made
a couple phone calls. But I never
want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's
my friend and you don't bust in your
friend's house and start tellin' 'im
what's what.

Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at
the sink.

VINCENT
Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He
kinda freaked out back there when he
saw Marvin.

JULES
Put yourself in his position. It's
eight o'clock in the morning. He
just woke up, he wasn't prepared for
this shit. Don't forget who's doin'
who a favor.

Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.

VINCENT
If the price of that favor is I gotta
take shit, he can stick his favor
straight up his ass.

When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is
stained with red.

JULES
What the fuck did you just do to his
towel?

VINCENT
I was just dryin' my hands.

JULES
You're supposed to wash 'em first.

VINCENT
You watched me wash 'em.

JULES
I watched you get 'em wet.

VINCENT
I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to
get off. Maybe if he had some Lava,
I coulda done a better job.

JULES
I used the same soap you did and
when I dried my hands, the towel
didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie
pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who
cares? But it's shit like this that's
gonna bring this situation to a boil.
If he were to come in here and see
that towel like that... I'm tellin'
you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause
if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie
on account of you... Look, I ain't
threatenin' you, I respect you an'
all, just don't put me in that
position.

JULES
Jules, you ask me nice like that, no
problem. He's your friend, you handle
him.

INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN – MORNING

Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug
of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in
his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe.

JULES
Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious
gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda
been satisfied with freeze-dried
Tasters Choice. You spring this
gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What
flavor is this?

JIMMIE
Knock it off, Julie.

JULES
What?

JIMMIE
I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can
stop butterin' me up. I don't need
you to tell me how good my coffee
is. I'm the one who buys it, I know
how fuckin' good it is. When Bonnie
goes shoppin;, she buys shit. I buy
the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
But what's on my mind at this moment
isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's
the dead nigger in my garage.

JULES
Jimmie –

JIMMIE
– I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a
question, Jules. When you drove in
here, did you notice a sign out front
that said, "Dead nigger storage?"

Jules starts to "Jimmie" him –

JIMMIE
– answer to question. Did you see a
sign out in front of my house that
said, "Dead nigger storage?"

JULES
(playing along)
Naw man, I didn't.

JIMMIE
You know why you didn't see that
sign?

JULES
Why?

JIMMIE
'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my
fuckin' business!

Jules starts to "Jimmie" him.

JIMMIE
– I ain't through! Now don't you
understand that if Bonnie comes home
and finds a dead body in her house,
I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage
counselor, no trial separation –
fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced. The last time
me an' Bonnie talked about this shit
was gonna be the last time me an'
Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I
wanna help ya out Julie, I really
do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife
doin' it.

JULES
Jimmie –

JIMMIE
– don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I
can't be Jimmied. There's nothin'
you can say that's gonna make me
forget I love my wife. Now she's
workin' the graveyard shift at the
hospital. She'll be comin' home in
less than an hour and a half. Make
your phone calls, talk to your people,
than get the fuck out of my house.

JULES
That's all we want. We don't wanna
fuck up your shit. We just need to
call our people to bring us in.

JIMMIE
Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's
in my bedroom.

INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S DINING ROOM – MORNING

Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy
robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.

MARSELLUS
...well, say she comes home. Whaddya
think she'll do?
(pause)
No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That
ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er,
I don't. How bad, a lot or a little?

INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING

Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.

JULES
You got to appreciate what an
explosive element this Bonnie
situation is. If she comes home from
a hard day's work and finds a bunch
of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta'
shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin'
what she's apt to do.

MARSELLUS
I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm
doin' is contemplating the "ifs."

JULES
I don't wanna hear about no
motherfuckin' "ifs."What I wanna
hear from your ass is: "you ain't
got no problems, Jules. I'm on the
motherfucker. Go back in there, chill
them niggers out and wait for the
cavalry, which should be comin'
directly."

MARSELLUS
You ain't got no problems, Jules.
I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in
there, chill them niggers out and
wait for The Wolf, who should be
comin' directly.

JULES
You sendin' The Wolf?

MARSELLUS
Feel better?

JULES
Shit Negro, that's all you had to
say.

INT. HOTEL SUITE – MORNING

The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite
into the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a
fancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in
fancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing:
Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the
tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka "THE WOLF". We also see The
Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in.

THE WOLF
(into phone)
Is she the hysterical type?
(pause)
When she due?
(jotting down)
Give me the principals' names again?
(jots down)
Jules...

We SEE his book. The page has written on it:

"1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head)
Bloody shot-up car Jules (black)"

THE WOLF
...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...

HE WRITES:

"Vincent (Dean Martin) Jimmie (house) Bonnie (9:30)"

THE WOLF
Expect a call around 10:30. It's
about thirty minutes away. I'll be
there in ten.

He hangs up. We never see his face.

CUT TO:

TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:

"NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER"

CUT TO:

EXT. JIMMIE'S STREET – MORNING

A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home,
in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a
dime in front of Jimmie's house.

A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.

INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE – MORNING

Jimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the
tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at
Jimmie.

THE WOLF
You're Jimmie, right? This is your
house?

JIMMIE
Yeah.

THE WOLF
(stick his hand out)
I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.

JIMMIE
Good, 'cause we got one.

THE WOLF
So I heard. May I come in?

JIMMIE
Please do.

In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.

THE WOLF
You must be Jules, which would make
you Vincent. Let's get down to brass
tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed
correctly, the clock is ticking, is
that right, Jimmie?

JIMMIE
100%.

THE WOLF
Your wife, Bonnie...
(refers to his pad)
...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is
that correct?

JIMMIE
Uh-huh.

THE WOLF
I was led to believe if she comes
home and finds us here, she wouldn't
appreciate it none too much.

JIMMIE
She won't at that.

THE WOLF
That gives us forty minutes to get
the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you
do what I say when I say it, should
by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a
car, minus a head, in a garage. Take
me to it.

INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING

The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He
studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside,
circling it.

THE WOLF
Jimmie?

JIMMIE
Yes.

THE WOLF
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee in there. Would
you make me a cup?

JIMMIE
Sure, how do you take it?

THE WOLF
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.

THE WOLF
About the car, is there anything I
need to know? Does it stall, does it
make a lot of noise, does it smoke,
is there gas in it, anything?

JULES
Aside from how it looks, the car's
cool.

THE WOLF
Positive? Don't get me out on the
road and I find out the brake lights
don't work.

JULES
Hey man, as far as I know, the
motherfucker's tip-top.

THE WOLF
Good enough, let's go back to the
kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN – MORNING

Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.

THE WOLF
Thank you, Jimmie.

He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the
three men the plan of action.

THE WOLF
Okay first thing, you two.
(meaning Jules and
Vincent)
Take the body, stick it in the trunk.
Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty
domesticated house. That would lead
me to believe that in the garage or
under the sink, you got a bunch of
cleansers and cleaners and shit like
that, am I correct?

JIMMIE
Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.

THE WOLF
Good. What I need you two fellas to
do is take those cleaning products
and clean the inside of the car. And
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You
need to go in the backseat, scoop up
all those little pieces of brain and
skull. Get it out of there. Wipe
down the upholstery – now when it
comes to upholstery, it don't need
to be spic and span, you don't need
to eat off it. Give it a good once
over. What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts. The pools
of blood that have collected, you
gotta soak that shit up. But the
windows are a different story. Them
you really clean. Get the Windex, do
a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to
raid your linen closet. I need
blankets, I need comforters, I need
quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker
the better, the darker the better.
No whites, can't use 'em. We need to
camouflage the interior of the car.
We're gonna line the front seat and
the backseat and the floor boards
with quilts and blankets. If a cop
stops us and starts stickin' his big
snout in the car, the subterfuge
won't last. But at a glance, the car
will appear to be normal. Jimmie –
lead the way, boys – get to work.

The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving
Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.

VINCENT
(calling after him)
A "please" would be nice.

The Wolf stops and turns around.

THE WOLF
Come again?

VINCENT
I said a "please" would be nice.

The Wolf takes a step toward him.

THE WOLF
Set is straight, Buster. I'm not
here to say "please."I'm here to
tell you want to do. And if self-
preservation is an instinct you
possess, you better fuckin' do it
and do it quick. I'm here to help.
If my help's not appreciated, lotsa
luck gentlemen.

JULES
It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your
help is definitely appreciated.

VINCENT
I don't mean any disrespect. I just
don't like people barkin' orders at
me.

THE WOLF
If I'm curt with you, it's because
time is a factor. I think fast, I
talk fast, and I need you guys to
act fast if you want to get out of
this. So pretty please, with sugar
on top, clean the fuckin' car.

INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING

Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he
has.

The Wolf is on the phone.

THE WOLF
(into phone)
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
(pause)
White.
(pause)
Nothin', except for the mess inside.
(pause)
About twenty minutes.
(pause)
Nobody who'll be missed.
(pause)
You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.
(he looks at Jimmie)
How we comin', Jimmie?

Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen.

JIMMIE
Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand
somethin' –

THE WOLF
– Winston, Jimmie – please, Winston.

JIMMIE
You gotta understand something,
Winston. I want to help you guys out
and all, but that's my best linen.
It was a wedding present from my
Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and
they ain't with us anymore –

THE WOLF
– let me ask you a question, if you
don't mind?

JIMMIE
Sure.

THE WOLF
Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny
millionaires?

JIMMIE
No.

THE WOLF
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And
I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and
Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they
would've furnished you with a whole
bedroom set, which your Uncle
Marsellus is more than happy to do.
(takes out a roll of
bills)
I like oak myself, that's what's in
my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie,
you an oak man?

JIMMIE
Oak's nice.

INT. GARAGE – MORNING

Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up.
Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is
in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs
of brain.

Both are twice as bloody as they were before.

JULES
I will never forgive your ass for
this shit. This is some fucked-up
repugnant shit!

VINCENT
Did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he's wrong,
he's immediately forgiven for all
wrong-doings?

JULES
Man, get outta my face with that
shit! The motherfucker who said that
never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces
of skull with his fingers on account
of your dumb ass.

VINCENT
I got a threshold, Jules. I got a
threshold for the abuse I'll take.
And you're crossin' it. I'm a race
car and you got me in the red. Redline
7000, that's where you are. Just
know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be
drivin' a race car when it's in the
red. It could blow.

JULES
You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a
mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!
Every time my fingers touch brain
I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS
OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker
usta talk about. In fact, what the
fuck am I doin' in the back? You're
the motherfucker should be on brain
detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin'
windows and you're pickin' up this
nigger's skull.

INT. CHEVY NOVA – MORNING

The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with
bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a
portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript
vehicle.

The Wolf circles the car examining it.

Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a
bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a
good job they've done.

THE WOLF
Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out
of this yet.

JIMMIE
I can't believe that's the same car.

THE WOLF
Well, let's not start suckin' each
other's dicks quite yet. Phase one
is complete, clean the car, which
moves us right along to phase two,
clean you two.

EXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD – MORNING

Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits,
covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic
Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one
of those guns nozzles attached.

THE WOLF
Strip.

VINCENT
All the way?

THE WOLF
To your bare ass.

As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.

THE WOLF
Quickly gentlemen, we got about
fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-
half comes pulling into the driveway.

JULES
This morning air is some chilly shit.

VINCENT
Are you sure this is absolutely
necessary?

THE WOLF
You know what you two look like?

VINCENT
What?

THE WOLF
Like a couple of guys who just blew
off somebody's head. Yes, strippin'
off those bloody rags is absolutely
necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's
garbage bag.

JULES
Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid
like puttin' that out in front of
your house for Elmo the garbage man
to take away.

THE WOLF
Don't worry, we're takin' it with
us. Jim, the soap.

He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.

THE WOLF
Okay gentlemen, you're both been to
County before, I'm sure. Here it
comes.

He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.

JULES
Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!

THE WOLF
Better you than me, gentlemen.

The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.

THE WOLF
Don't be afraid of the soap, spread
it around.

The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.

THE WOLF
Towel 'em.

Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously
across their bodies.

THE WOLF
You're dry enough, give 'em their
clothes.

FADE UP ON:

JULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They
look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses
we first met.

THE WOLF
Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've
planned this better. You guys look
like... what do they look like,
Jimmie?

JIMMIE
Dorks. They look like a couple of
dorks.

The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.

JULES
Ha ha ha. They're your clothes,
motherfucker.

JIMMIE
I guess you just gotta know how to
wear them.

JULES
Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert
on wearin' dorky shit that your is.

THE WOLF
C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and
jokin' our way into prison. Don't
make me beg.

INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING

The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin.
The Wolf SLAMS is closed.

THE WOLF
Gentlemen, let's get our rules of
the road straight. We're going to a
place called Monster Joe's Truck and
Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter
Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.
The place is North Hollywood, so a
few twist and turns aside, we'll be
goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll
drive the tainted car. Jules, you
ride with me. Vincent, you follow
in my Porsche. Now if we cross the
path of any John Q. Laws, nobody
does a fuckin' thing 'til I do
something.

(TO JULES)
What did I say?

JULES
Don't do shit unless –

THE WOLF
– unless what?

JULES
Unless you do it first.

THE WOLF
Spoken like a true prodigy.
(to Vincent)
How 'bout you, Lash Larue? Can you
keep your spurs from jingling and
jangling?

VINCENT
I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went
off, I dunno how.

THE WOLF
Fair enough.
(he throws Vince his
car keys)
I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep
up. If I get my car back any different
than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna
be disposing of two bodies.

EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW – MORNING

Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.

JULES
We cool?

WINSTON
Like it never happened.

Jules and Vincent bump fists.

WINSTON
Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all
this will be hers.

RAQUEL
(to the boys)
Hi. You know, if they ever do "I
SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys,
I'd be great. What's with the
outfits. You guys going to a
volleyball game?

Winston laughs, the boys groan.

WINSTON
I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast.
Maybe I can drop you two off. Where
do you live?

VINCENT
Redondo Beach.

JULES
Inglewood.

Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a
"DEAD ZONE" trance.

WINSTON
(painfully)
It's your future: I see... a cab
ride.
(dropping the act)
Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
(to Raquel)
Say goodbye, Raquel.

RAQUEL
Goodbye, Raquel.

WINSTON
I'll see you two around, and stay
outta trouble, you crazy kids.

Winston turns to leave.

JULES
Mr. Wolf.

He turns around.

JULES
I was a pleasure watchin' you work.

The Wolf smiles.

WINSTON
Call me Winston.

He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.

WINSTON
You hear that, young lady? Respect.
You could lean a lot from those two
fine specimens. Respect for one's
elders shows character.

RAQUEL
I have character.

WINSTON
Just because you are a character
doesn't mean you have character.

RAQUEL
Oh you're so funny, oh you're so
funny.

The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.

The two men left alone look at each other.

JULES
Wanna share a cab?

VINCENT
You know I could go for some
breakfast. Want to have breakfast
with me?

JULES
Sure.

INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a
big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto.
Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a
muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a
refill for both men,

VINCENT
Thanks a bunch.
(to Jules, who's
nursing his coffee)
Want a sausage?

JULES
Naw, I don't eat pork.

VINCENT
Are you Jewish?

JULES
I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig
on swine.

VINCENT
Why not?

JULES
They're filthy animals. I don't eat
filthy animals.

VINCENT
Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste
good.

JULES
A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin
pie. I'll never know 'cause even if
it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy
motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in
shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't
wanna eat nothin' that ain't got
enough sense to disregard its own
feces.

VINCENT
How about dogs? Dogs eat their own
feces.

JULES
I don't eat dog either.

VINCENT
Yes, but do you consider a dog to be
a filthy animal?

JULES
I wouldn't go so far as to call a
dog filthy, but they're definitely
dirty. But a dog's got personality.
And personality goes a long way.

VINCENT
So by that rationale, if a pig had a
better personality, he's cease to be
a filthy animal?

JULES
We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one
motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd
have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.

The two men laugh.

VINCENT
Good for you. Lighten up a little.
You been sittin' there all quiet.

JULES
I just been sittin' here thinkin'.

VINCENT
(mouthful of food)
About what?

JULES
The miracle we witnessed.

VINCENT
The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed
a freak occurrence.

JULES
Do you know that a miracle is?

VINCENT
An act of God.

JULES
What's an act of God?

VINCENT
I guess it's when God makes the
impossible possible. And I'm sorry
Jules, but I don't think what happened
this morning qualifies.

JULES
Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't
matter. You're judging this thing
the wrong way. It's not about what.
It could be God stopped the bullets,
he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found
my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge
shit like this based on merit. Whether
or not what we experienced was an
according-to-Hoyle miracle is
insignificant. What is significant
is I felt God's touch, God got
involved.

VINCENT
But why?

JULES
That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I
don't know why. But I can't go back
to sleep.

VINCENT
So you're serious, you're really
gonna quit?

JULES
The life, most definitely.

Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In
the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.

PATRON
Garcon! Coffee!

We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene
of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.

VINCENT
So if you're quitting the life,
what'll you do?

JULES
That's what I've been sitting here
contemplating. First, I'm gonna
deliver this case to Marsellus. Then,
basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.

VINCENT
What do you mean, walk the earth?

JULES
You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU."
Just walk from town to town, meet
people, get in adventures.

VINCENT
How long do you intend to walk the
earth?

JULES
Until God puts me where he want me
to be.

VINCENT
What if he never does?

JULES
If it takes forever, I'll wait
forever.

VINCENT
So you decided to be a bum?

JULES
I'll just be Jules, Vincent – no
more, no less.

VINCENT
No Jules, you're gonna be like those
pieces of shit out there who beg for
change. They walk around like a bunch
of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in
garbage bins, they eat what I throw
away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got
a word for 'em, they're called bums.
And without a job, residence, or
legal tender, that's what you're
gonna be – a fuckin' bum!

JULES
Look my friend, this is just where
me and you differ –

VINCENT
– what happened was peculiar – no
doubt about it – but it wasn't water
into wine.

JULES
All shapes and sizes, Vince.

VINCENT
Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!

JULES
If you find my answers frightening,
Vincent, you should cease askin'
scary questions.

VINCENT
I gotta take a shit. To be continued.

Vincent exits for the restroom.

Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin
and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.

PUMPKIN
Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!

HONEY BUNNY
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
I'll execute every one of you
motherfuckers! Got that?!

Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the
table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it
out, COCKING IT.

PUMPKIN
Customers stay seated, waitresses on
the floor.

HONEY BUNNY
Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die,
do it or fucking die!

Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While
Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them
terrified.

PUMPKIN
You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out
here! Asta luego!

Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.

PUMPKIN
On the floor or I'll cook you ass,
comprende?

They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.

MANAGER
I'm the manager here, there's no
problem, no problem at all –

Pumpkin heads his way.

PUMPKIN
You're gonna give me a problem?

He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the
Manager's neck.

PUMPKIN
What? You said you're gonna give me
a problem?

MANAGER
No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you
any problem!

PUMPKIN
I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks
like the hero type to me!

HONEY BUNNY
Don't take any chances. Execute him!

The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his
hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.

MANAGER
Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm
just a coffee shop manager. Take
anything you want.

PUMPKIN
Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll
be all over.

MANAGER
Everybody just be calm and cooperate
with them and this will be all over
soon!

PUMPKIN
Well done, now git your fuckin' ass
on the ground.

INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM – MORNING

Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside,
reads his "MODESTY BLAISE" book.

INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from
the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter
with a trash bag in his hand.

PUMPKIN
Okay people, I'm going to go 'round
and collect your wallets. Don't talk,
just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?

Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his
.45 ready to spit under the table.

Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet,
briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more
respectful, him manner more on guard.

PUMPKIN
In the bag.

Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer,
Pumpkin points to the briefcase.

PUMPKIN
What's in that?

JULES
My boss' dirty laundry.

PUMPKIN
You boss makes you do his laundry?

JULES
When he wants it clean.

PUMPKIN
Sounds like a shit job.

JULES
Funny, I've been thinkin' the same
thing.

PUMPKIN
Open it up.

Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.

JULES
'Fraid I can't do that.

Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the
gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the
hammer.

PUMPKIN
I didn't hear you.

JULES
Yes, you did.

This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard
it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.

HONEY BUNNY
What's goin' on?

PUMPKIN
Looks like we got a vigilante in our
midst.

HONEY BUNNY
Shoot 'em in the face!

JULES
I don't mean to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time I've
had gun pointed at me.

PUMPKIN
You don't open up that case, it's
gonna be the last.

MANAGER
(on the ground)
Quit causing problems, you'll get us
all killed! Give 'em what you got
and get 'em out of here.

JULES
Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat
man, this ain't any of your goddamn
business!

PUMPKIN
I'm countin' to three, and if your
hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna
unload right in your fuckin' face.
Clear? One...

PUMPKIN
...two... three.

JULES
You win.

Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.

JULES
It's all yours, Ringo.

PUMPKIN
Open it.

Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to
Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case.
Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across
the room, can't see shit.

HONEY BUNNY
What is it? What is it?

PUMPKIN
(softly)
Is that what I think it is?

Jules nods his head: "yes."

PUMPKIN
It's beautiful.

Jules nods his head: "yes."

HONEY BUNNY
Goddammit, what is it?

Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering
the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to
pick up the case.

Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of
Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand
comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45
hand under Pumpkin's chin.

Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.

HONEY BUNNY
Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow
your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya!
I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're
gonna fuckin' die bad!

JULES
(to Pumpkin)
Tell that bitch to be cool! Say,
bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!

PUMPKIN
Chill out, honey!

HONEY BUNNY
Let him go!

JULES
(softly)
Tell her it's gonna be okay.

PUMPKIN
I'm gonna be okay.

JULES
Promise her.

PUMPKIN
I promise.

JULES
Tell her to chill.

PUMPKIN
Just chill out.

JULES
What's her name?

PUMPKIN
Yolanda.

Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only
at Pumpkin.

JULES
(to Yolanda)
So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna
do anything stupid, are we?

YOLANDA
(crying)
Don't you hurt him.

JULES
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're
gonna be like three Fonzies. And
what' Fonzie like?

No answer.

JULES
C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?

YOLANDA
(through tears, unsure)
He's cool?

JULES
Correct-amundo! And that's what we're
gonna be, we're gonna be cool.
(to Pumpkin)
Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three
and I want you to let go your gun
and lay your palms flat on the table.
But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?

Pumpkin looks at him.

JULES
One... two... three.

Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.

Yolanda can't stand it anymore.

YOLANDA
Okay, now let him go!

JULES
Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be
cool. When you yell at me, it makes
me nervous. When I get nervous, I
get scared. And when motherfuckers
get scared, that's when motherfuckers
get accidentally shot.

YOLANDA
(more conversational)
Just know: you hurt him, you die.

JULES
That seems to be the situation. Now
I don't want that and you don't want
that and Ringo here don't want that.
So let's see what we can do.
(to Ringo)
Now this is the situation. Normally
both of your asses would be dead as
fuckin' fried chicken. But you
happened to pull this shit while I'm
in a transitional period. I don't
wanna kill ya, I want to help ya.
But I'm afraid I can't give you the
case. It don't belong to me. Besides,
I went through too much shit this
morning on account of this case to
just hand it over to your ass.

VINCENT (O.S.)
What the fuck's goin' on here?

Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.

Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at
Yolanda.

JULES
It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't
do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's
cool baby, nothin's changed. We're
still just talkin'.
(to Pumpkin)
Tell her we're still cool.

PUMPKIN
It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still
cool.

VINCENT
(gun raised)
What the hell's goin' on, Jules?

JULES
Nothin' I can't handle. I want you
to just hang back and don't do shit
unless it's absolutely necessary.

VINCENT
Check.

JULES
Yolanda, how we doin, baby?

YOLANDA
I gotta go pee! I want to go home.

JULES
Just hang in there, baby, you're
doing' great, Ringo's proud of you
and so am I. It's almost over.
(to Pumpkin)
Now I want you to go in that bag and
find my wallet.

PUMPKIN
Which one is it?

JULES
It's the one that says Bad
Motherfucker on it.

Pumpkin looks in the bag and – sure enough – there's a wallet
with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it.

JULES
That's my bad motherfucker. Now open
it up and take out the cash. How
much is there?

PUMPKIN
About fifteen hundred dollars.

JULES
Put it in your pocket, it's yours.
Now with the rest of them wallets
and the register, that makes this a
pretty successful little score.

VINCENT
Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen
hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on
general principle.

JULES
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing,
now hang back and shut the fuck up.
Besides, I ain't givin' it to him.
I'm buyin' somethin' for my money.
Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?

PUMPKIN
What?

JULES
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't hafta kill your ass. You
read the Bible?

PUMPKIN
Not regularly.

JULES
There's a passage I got memorized.
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of the darkness. For he
is truly his brother's keeper and
the finder of lost children. And I
will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know I am the
Lord when I lay my vengeance upon
you." I been sayin' that shit for
years. And if you ever heard it, it
meant your ass. I never really
questioned what it meant. I thought
it was just a coldblooded thing to
say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped
a cap in his ass. But I saw some
shit this mornin' made me think twice.
Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're
the evil man. And I'm the righteous
man. And Mr. .45 here, he's the
shepherd protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness. Or is
could by you're the righteous man
and I'm the shepherd and it's the
world that's evil and selfish. I'd
like that. But that shit ain't the
truth. The truth is you're the weak.
And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But
I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to
be a shepherd.

Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.

Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to
Yolanda.

She looks back.

Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the
door.

Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time,
takes a sip of coffee.

JULES
(to himself)
It's cold.

He pushes it aside.

Vincent appears next to Jules.

VINCENT
I think we oughta leave now.

JULES
That's probably a good idea.

Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the
briefcase.

Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the
Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes
– wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts,
swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics – walk out of
the coffee shop together without saying a word.

FADE OUT

THE END


1 INT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING

Eight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a
breakfast cafe. They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE,
MR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT,
and the big boss, JOE CABOT. Most are finished eating and
are enjoying coffee and conversation. Joe flips through a
small address book. Mr. Pink is telling a long and
involved story about Madonna.

MR. PINK
"Like a Virgin" is all about a
girl who digs a guy with a big
dick. The whole song is a
metaphor for big dicks.

MR. BLUE
No it's not. It's about a girl
who is very vulnerable and she's
been fucked over a few times.
Then she meets some guy who's
really sensitive--

MR. PINK
--Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay.
Tell that bullshit to the
tourists.

JOE
(looking through his
address book)
Toby...who the fuck is Toby?
Toby...Toby...think...think...
think...

MR. PINK
It's not about a nice girl who
meets a sensitive boy. Now
granted that's what "True Blue" is
about, no argument about that.

MR. ORANGE
Which one is "True Blue?"

NICE GUY EDDIE
You don't remember "True Blue?"
That was a big ass hit for
Madonna. Shit, I don't even
follow this Tops In Pops shit, and
I've at least heard of "True
Blue."

MR. ORANGE
Look, asshole, I didn't say I
ain't heard of it. All I asked
was how does it go? Excuse me
for not being the world's biggest
Madonna fan.

MR. BROWN
I hate Madonna.

MR. BLUE
I like her early stuff. You know,
"Lucky Star," "Borderline" - but
once she got into her "Papa Don't
Preach" phase, I don't know, I
tuned out.

MR. PINK
Hey, fuck all that, I'm
making a point here. You're gonna
make me lose my train
of thought.

JOE
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china
girl.

MR. WHITE
What's that?

JOE
I found this old address book in a
jacket I ain't worn in a coon's
age. Toby what? What the fuck
was her last name?

MR. PINK
Where was I?

MR. ORANGE
You said "True Blue" was about a
nice girl who finds a sensitive
fella. But "Like a Virgin" was a
metaphor for big dicks.

MR. PINK
Let me tell ya what "Like a
Virgin"'s about. It's about some
cooze who's a regular fuck
machine.
I mean all the time, morning, day,
night, afternoon, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick.

MR. BLUE
How many dicks was that?

MR. WHITE
A lot.

MR. PINK
Then one day she meets a John
Holmes motherfucker, and it's
like, whoa baby. This mother
fucker's like Charles Bronson in
"The Great Escape." He's diggin
tunnels. Now she's gettin this
serious dick action, she's feelin
something she ain't felt since
forever. Pain.

JOE
Chew? Toby Chew? No.

MR. PINK
It hurts. It hurts her. It
shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should
be Bubble-Yum by now. But when
this cat fucks her, it hurts. It
hurts like the first time. The
pain is reminding a fuck machine
what is was like to be a virgin.
Hence, "Like a Virgin."

The fellas crack up.

JOE
Wong?

MR. PINK
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What
the fuck do you know about it
anyway? You're still listening to
Jerry-fucking-Vale.

JOE
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You
know, like the Chinese name?

Mr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand. They
fight, but they're not really mad at each other.

MR. WHITE
Give me this fucking thing.

JOE
What the fuck do you think you're
doin? Give me my book back!

MR. WHITE
I'm sick of fuckin hearin it Joe,
I'll give it back when we leave.

JOE
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when
we leave, give it back now.

MR. WHITE
For the past fifteen minutes now,
you've just been droning on with
names. "Toby...Toby...Toby...
Toby Wong...Toby Wong...Toby
Chung...fuckin Charlie Chan." I
got Madonna's big dick outta my
right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-
know-what, outta my left.

JOE
What do you care?

MR. WHITE
When you're annoying as hell, I
care a lot.

JOE
Give me my book.

MR. WHITE
You gonna put it away?

JOE
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do
with it.

MR. WHITE
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to keep it.

MR. BLONDE
Joe, you want me to shoot him for
you?

MR. WHITE
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you
better wake up and apologize.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Have you guys been listening to K-
BILLY's super sounds of the
seventies weekend?

MR. PINK
Yeah, it's fuckin great isn't it?

NICE GUY EDDIE
Can you believe the songs they
been playin?

MR. PINK
No, I can't. You know what I
heard the other day? "Heartbeat -
It's Lovebeat," by little Tony
DeFranco and the DeFranco Family.
I haven't heard that since I was
in fifth fuckin grade.

NICE GUY EDDIE
When I was coming down here, I was
playin it. And "The Night the
Lights Went Out in Georgia" came
on. Now I ain't heard that song
since it was big, but when it was
big, I heard it a million-
trillion times. I'm listening to
it this morning, and this was the
first time I ever realized that
the lady singing the song, was the
one who killed Andy.

MR. BLUE
You didn't know Vicki Lawrence
killed the guy?

NICE GUY EDDIE
I thought the cheatin wife shot
Andy.

MR. BLONDE
They say it in the song.

NICE GUY EDDIE
I know, I heard it. I musta zoned
out whenever that part came on
before. I thought when she said
that little sister stuff, she was
talkin about her sister- in-law,
the cheatin wife.

JOE
No, she did it. She killed the
cheatin wife, too.

MR. PINK
You know the part in "Gypsies,
Tramps and Theives," when she says
"Poppa woulda shot his if he knew
what he'd done?" I could never
figure out what he did.

The table laughs. The WAITRESS comes over to the table.
She has the check, and a pot of coffee.

WAITRESS
Can I get anybody more
coffee.

JOE
No, we're gonna be hittin it.
I'll take care of the check.

She hands the bill to him.

WAITRESS
Here ya go. Please pay at the
register, if you wouldn't mind.

JOE
Sure thing.

WAITRESS
You guys have a wonderful day.

They all mutter equivalents. She exits and Joe stands up.

JOE
I'll take care of this, you guys
leave the tip.
(to Mr. White)
And when I come back, I want my
book back.

MR. WHITE
Sorry, it's my book now.

JOE
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit,
will ya?

Mr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger. Mr White
acts shot. Joe exits.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Okay, everybody cough up green for
the little lady.

Everybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table.
Everybody, that is, except Mr. White.

NICE GUY EDDIE
C'mon, throw in a buck.

MR. WHITE
Uh-uh. I don't tip.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?

MR. WHITE
I don't believe in it.

NICE GUY EDDIE
You don't believe in tipping?

MR. PINK
(laughing)
I love this kid, he's a madman,
this guy.

MR. BLONDE
Do you have any idea what these
ladies make? They make shit.

MR. WHITE
Don't give me that. She don't
make enough money, she can quit.

Everybody laughs.

NICE GUY EDDIE
I don't even know a Jew who'd have
the balls to say that. So let's
get this straight. You never ever
tip?

MR. WHITE
I don't tip because society says I
gotta. I tip when somebody
deserves a tip. When somebody
really puts forth an effort, they
deserve a little something extra.
But this tipping automatically,
that shit's for the birds. As far
as I'm concerned, they're just
doin their job.

MR. BLUE
Our girl was nice.

MR. WHITE
Our girl was okay. She didn't do
anything special.

MR. BLONDE
What's something special, take ya
in the kitchen and suck your dick?

They all laugh.

NICE GUY EDDIE
I'd go over twelve percent for
that.

MR. WRITE
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've
been here a long fuckin time, and
she's only filled my cup three
times. When I order coffee, I
want it filled six times.

MR. BLONDE
What if she's too busy?

MR. WHITE
The words "too busy" shouldn't be
in a waitress's vocabulary.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Excuse me, Mr. White, but the last
thing you need is another cup of
coffee.

They all laugh.

MR. WHITE
These ladies aren't starvin to
death. They make minimum wage.
When I worked for minimum wage, I
wasn't lucky enough to have a job
that society deemed tipworthy.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Ahh, now we're getting down to it.
It's not just that he's a cheap
bastard--

MR. ORANGE
--It is that too--

NICE GUY EDDIE
--It is that too. But it's also
he couldn't get a waiter job. You
talk like a pissed off dishwasher:
"Fuck those cunts and their
fucking tips."

MR. BLONDE
So you don't care that they're
counting on your tip to live?

Mr. White rubs two of his fingers together.

MR. WHITE
Do you know what this is? It's
the world's smallest violin,
playing just for the waitresses.

MR. BLONDE
You don't have any idea what
you're talking about. These
people bust their ass. This
is a hard job.

MR. WHITE
So's working at McDonald's, but
you don't feel the need to tip
them. They're servin ya food, you
should tip em. But no, society
says tip these guys over here, but
not those guys over there. That's
bullshit.

MR. ORANGE
They work harder than the kids at
McDonald's.

MR. WHITE
Oh yeah, I don't see them cleaning
fryers.

MR. BROWN
These people are taxed on the tips
they make. When you stiff 'em,
you cost them money.

MR. BLONDE
Waitressing is the number one
occupation for female non-college
graduates in this country. It's
the one jab basically any woman
can get, and make a living on.
The reason is because of tips.

MR. WHITE
Fuck all that.

They all laugh.

MR. WHITE
Hey, I'm very sorry that the
government taxes their tips.
That's fucked up. But that ain't
my fault. it would appear that
waitresses are just one of the
many groups the government fucks
in the ass on a regular basis.
You show me a paper says the
government shouldn't do that, I'll
sign it. Put it to a vote, I'll
vote for it. But what I won't do
is play ball. And this non-
college bullshit you're telling
me, I got two words for that:
"Learn to fuckin type." Cause if
you're expecting me to help out
with the rent, you're in for a big
fuckin surprise.

MR. ORANGE
He's convinced me. Give me my
dollar back.

Everybody laughs. Joe's comes back to the table.

JOE
Okay ramblers, let's get to
rambling. Wait a minute, who
didn't throw in?

MR. ORANGE
Mr. White.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
Mr. White?
(to Mr. White)
Why?

MR. ORANGE
He don't tip.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
He don't tip?
(to Mr. White)
You don't tip? Why?

MR. ORANGE
He don't believe in it.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
He don't believe in it?
(to Mr. White)
You don't believe in it?

MR. ORANGE
Nope.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
Shut up!
(to Mr. White)
Cough up the buck, ya cheap
bastard, I paid for your goddamn
breakfast.

MR. WHITE
Because you paid for the
breakfast, I'm gonna tip.
Normally I wouldn't.

JOE
Whatever. Just throw in your
dollar, and let's move.
(to Mr. Blonde)
See what I'm dealing with here.
Infants. I'm fuckin dealin with
infants.

The eight men get up to leave. Mr. White's waist is in
the F.G. As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's
carrying a gun. They exit Uncle Bob's Pancake House,
talking amongst themselves.


2 EXT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY

CREDIT SEQUENCE:

When the credit sequence is finished, we FADE TO BLACK:

Over the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in
agony.

Under the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING
ASS, through traffic.

Over the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY
ELSE SAY:

SOMEBODY ELSE (OS)
Just hold on buddy boy.

Somebody stops screaming long enough to say:

SOMEBODY (OS)
I'm sorry. I can't believe
she killed me. Who would've
fuckin thought that?

CUT TO:

3 INT. GETAWAY GAR (MOVING) - DAY

The Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange. He lies in the
backseat. He's been SHOT in the stomach. BLOOD covers
both him and the backseat.

Mr. White is the Somebody Else. He's behind the wheel of
the getaway car. He's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and
out of traffic. Though he's driving for his life, he
keeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat.

They are the only two in the car.

MR. WHITE
Hey, just cancel that shit right
now! You're hurt. You're hurt
really fucking bad, but you ain't
dying.

MR. ORANGE
(crying)
All this blood is scaring the shit
outta me. I'm gonna die, I know
it.

MR. WHITE
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you
had a degree in medicine. Are you
a doctor? Are you a doctor?
Answer me please, are you a
doctor?

MR. ORANGE
No, I'm not!

MR. WRITE
Ahhhh, so you admit you don't know
what you're talking about. So if
you're through giving me your
amateur opinion, lie back and
listen to the news. I'm taking
you back to the rendezvous, Joe's
gonna get you a doctor, the
doctor's gonna fix you up, and
you're gonna be okay. Now say it:
you're gonna be okay. Say it:
you're gonna be okay!

Mr. Orange doesn't respond. Mr. White starts pounding on
the steering wheel.

MR. WHITE
Say-the-goddamn-words: you're
gonna be okay!

MR. ORANGE
I'm okay.

MR. WHITE
(softly)
Correct.

4 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The CAMERA does a 360 around an empty warehouse. Then the
door swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of
Mr. Orange inside.

Mr. Orange still is MOANING loudly from his bullet hit.

Mr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor.

MR. WHITE
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on,
and wait for Joe. I can't do
anything for you, but when Joe
gets here, which should be anytime
now, he'll be able to help you.
We're just gonna sit here, and
wait for Joe. Who are
we waiting for?

MR. ORANGE
Joe.

MR. WHITE
Bet your sweet ass we are.

Mr. White gets up from over Mr. Orange and starts to prowl
around the warehouse.

MR. ORANGE
(yelling)
Don't leave me!

Mr White bends back over him and takes his hand.

MR. WHITE
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right
here. I'm not gonna leave ya.

MR. ORANGE
Larry, I'm so scared, would you
please hold me.

Mr. White very gently embraces the bloody Mr. Orange.
Cradling the young man, Mr. White whispers to him.

MR. WHITE
(whispering)
Go ahead and be scared, you've
been brave enough for one day. I
want you to just relax now.
You're not gonna die, you're gonna
be fine. When Joe gets here,
he'll make ya a hundred percent
again.

Mr. White lays Mr. Orange back down on the mattress. He's
still holding his hand. Mr. Orange looks up at his
friend.

MR. ORANGE
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in
the ointment, but if help doesn't
come soon, I gotta see a doctor.
I don't give a fuck about jail, I
just don't wanna die.

MR. WHITE
You're not gonna fucking die, all
right?

MR. ORANGE
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm
hurt, and I'm hurt bad.

MR. WHITE
It's not good...

MR. ORANGE
Hey, bless your heart for what
you're trying to do. I was
panicking for a moment, but I've
got my senses back now. The
situation is, I'm shot in the
belly. And without medical
attention, I'm gonna die.

MR. WHITE
I can' take you to a hospital.

MR. ORANGE
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit
about jail. But I can't die. You
don't have to take me in. Just
drive me up to the front, drop me
on the sidewalk. I'll take care
of myself. I won't tell them
anything. I swear to fucking god,
I won't tell 'em anything. Look
in my eyes, look right in my eyes.
(Mr. White does)
I-won't-tell-them-anything.
You'll be safe.

MR. WHITE
Lie back down, and try to--

MR. ORANGE
I'm going to die! I need a
doctor! I'm begging you,
take me to a doctor.

Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress. Spent from
his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:

MR. ORANGE
Take me to a doctor, take me to a
doctor, please.

Suddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr.
Pink steps inside.

MR. PINK
Was that a fucking set-up or what?

Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody.

MR. PINK
Oh fuck, Orange got tagged.

Throughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning.

MR. WHITE
Gun shot.

MR. PINK
Oh that's just fucking great!
Where's Brown?

MR. WHITE
Dead.

MR. PINK
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?

MR. WHITE
How the fuck do you think? The
cops shot him.

MR. PINK
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.
(referring to Mr.
Orange)
Is it bad?

MR. WHITE
As opposed to good?

MR. PINK
This is so fucked up. Somebody
fucked us big time.

MR. WHITE
You really think we were set up?

MR. PINK
You even doubt it? I don't think
we got set up, I know we got set
up! I mean really, seriously,
where did all those cops come
from, huh? One minute they're not
there, the next minute
they're there. I didn't hear any
sirens. The alarm went off, okay.
Okay, when an alarm goes off, you
got an average of four minutes
response time. Unless a patrol
car is cruising that street, at
that particular moment, you got
four minutes before they can
realistically respond. In one
minute there were seventeen blue
boys out there. All loaded for
bear, all knowing exactly what the
fuck they were doing, and they
were all just there! Remember
that second wave that showed up in
the cars? Those were the ones
responding to the alarm. but
those other motherfuckers were
already there, they were waiting
for us.
(pause)
You haven't thought about this?

MR. WHITE
I haven't had a chance to think.
First I was just trying to get the
fuck outta there. And after we
got away, I've just been dealin
with him.

MR. PINK
Well, you better start thinking
about it. Cause I, sure as fuck,
am thinking about it. In fact,
that's all I'm thinking about. I
came this close to just driving
off. Whoever set us up, knows
about this place. There could've
been cops sitting here waiting for
me. For all we know, there's
cops, driving fast, on their way
here now.

MR. WHITE
Let's go in the other room...

The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner. We
move past it, and see down a hall.

5 INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY

At the end of the hall is a bathroom. The bathroom door
is partially closed, restricting our view. Mr. Pink is
obscured, but Mr. White is in view.

MR. PINK (OS)
What the fuck am I doing here? I
felt funny about this job right
off. As soon as I felt it I
should said "No thank you", and
walked. But I never fucking
listen. Every time I ever got
burned buying weed, I always knew
the guy wasn't right. I just felt
it. But I wanted to believe him.
If he's not lyin to me, and it
really is Thai stick, then whoa
baby. But it's never Thai stick.
and I always said if I felt that
way about a job, I'd walk. And I
did, and I didn't, because of
fuckin money!

MR. WHITE
What's done is done, I need you
cool. Are you cool?

MR. PINK
I'm cool.

MR. WHITE
Splash some water on your face.
Take a breather.

We hear the sink running, and Mr. Pink splashing water on
his face.

MR. WHITE
I'm gonna get me my smokes.

Mr White opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and
OUT OF FRAME. We see Mr. Pink, his back turned towards
us, bent over the sink. Then he grabs a towels, and dries
his face. Mr White ENTERS FRAME with a pack of
Chesterfields in his hand.

MR. WHITE
Want a smoke?

MR. PINK
Why not?

The two men light up.

MR. WHITE
Okay, let's go through what
happened. We're in the place,
everything's going fine. Then the
alarm gets tripped. I turn around
and all these cops are outside.
You're right, it was like, bam! I
blink my eyes are they're there.
Everybody starts going apeshit.
Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin all
the--

MR. PINK
--That's not correct.

MR. WHITE
What's wrong with it?

MR. PINK
The cops didn't show up after the
alarm went off. They didn't show
till after Mr. Blonde started
shooting everyone.

MR. WHITE
As soon as I heard the alarm, I
saw the cops.

MR. PINK
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that
soon. They didn't let their
presence be known until after Mr.
Blonde went off. I'm not sayin
they weren't there, I'm sayin they
were there. But they didn't move
in till Mr. Blonde became a
madman. That's how I know we were
set up. You can see that,
can't you, Mr. White?

MR. WHITE
Look, enough of this "Mr White"
shit--

MR. PINK
--Don't tell me your name, I don't
want to know! I sure as hell
ain't gonna tell ya
mine.

MR. WHITE
You're right, this is bad.
(pause)
How did you get out?

MR. PINK
Shot my way out. Everybody was
shooting, so I just blasted my way
outta there.

CUT TO:


6 EXT. CROWDED CITY STREET - DAY

Mr. Pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk. He has
a canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a .357
MAGNUM in the other. If any BYSTANDERS get in his way, he
just knocks them down. We DOLLY at the same speed, right
along side of him.

FOUR POLICEMEN are running after Mr. Pink. We DOLLY with
them.

We DOLLY with a young woman on roller skates. ROLLERGIRL
is plugged into a walkman. We hear the song she's
listening to LOUD over the SOUNDTRACK. She's twirling and
skating backwards to the beat of the song.

Rollergirl turns a corner and COLLIDES with Mr. Pink. The
man and woman CRASH to the ground.

Mr. Pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car
that SCREECHES to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over
him.


7 INT. CAR (STOPPED) - DAY

The CAMERA is in the backseat. A SHOCKED WOMAN is the
car's driver. Mr. Pink pulls himself up from the hood,
shakes it off, and points his magnum at the driver.

MR. PINK
Get outta the car! Get the fuck
outta the car!

The Shocked Woman starts screaming.

Mr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's
locked.

MR. PINK
Open the fucking door!

EXTREME C.U. DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW

Mr. Pink SMASHES it in our face.


8 EXT. STREET - DAY

DOLLY with Cops coming up fast.

Mr. Pink DRAGS the Shocked Woman out of the car.

The Cops reach the corner, guns aimed.

Using the car as a shield, Mr. Pink FIRES three shots at
the Cops.

Everybody HITS the ground, or scatters.

Mr. Pink HOPS in the car.

Cops FIRE.


9 INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

CAMERA in the backseat, Mr. Pink FLOORS it. SPEEDING down
the street, with the Cops FIRING after him.

BACK TO:


10 INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Mr. Pink and Mr. White still talking in the bathroom.

MR. PINK
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you
kill anybody?

MR. WHITE
A few cops.

MR. PINK
No real people?

MR. WHITE
Uh-uh, just cops.

MR. PINK
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

MR. WHITE
That was one of the most insane
fucking things I've ever seen.
Why the fuck would Joe hire
somebody like that?

MR. PINK
I don't wanna kill anybody. But
if I gotta get out that door, and
you're standing in my way, one way
of the other, you're gettin outta
my way.

MR. WHITE
That's the way I look at it. A
choice between doin ten years, and
takin out some stupid
motherfucker, ain't no choice at
all. But I ain't no madman
either. What the fuck was Joe
thinkin? You can't work with a
guy like that. That mother-
fucker's unstable. What do you
think? Do you think he panicked,
or ya think he's just trigger-
happy?

MR. PINK
I think he's a sick fuckin maniac!
We're awful goddamn lucky he
didn't tag us, when
he shot up the place. I came this
fucking close--
(hold up two fingers
and makes a tiny
space between them)
--to taking his ass out myself.
Everybody panics. When things get
tense, everybody panics.
Everybody. I don't care what your
name is, you can't help it. It's
human nature. But ya panic on the
inside.
Ya panic in your head. Ya give
yourself a couple a seconds of
panic, then you get a grip and
deal with the situation. What you
don't do, is shoot up the place
and kill everybody.

MR. WHITE
What you're supposed to do is act
like a fuckin professional. A
psychopath is not a professional.
You can't work with a psychopath,
'cause ya don't know what those
sick assholes are gonna do next.
I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do
you think that black girl was?
Twenty, maybe twenty-one?

MR. PINK
Did ya see what happened to
anybody else?

MR. WHITE
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the
car and Mr. Brown floored it.
After that, I don't know what went
down.

MR. PINK
At that point it became every man
for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde
or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't
got the foggiest. Once
I got out, I never looked back.

MR. WHITE
What do you think?

MR. PINK
What do I think? I think the cops
caught them, or killed 'em.

MR. WHITE
Not even a chance they punched
through? You found a hole.

MR. PINK
Yeah, and that was a fucking
miracle. But if they did get
away, where the fuck are they?

MR. WHITE
You don't think it's possible, one
of them got ahold of the diamonds
and pulled a--

MR. PINK
Nope.

MR. WHITE
How can you be so sure?

MR. PINK
I got the diamonds.

MR. WHITE
Where?

MR. PINK
I got 'em, all right?

MR. WHITE
Where? Are they out in the car?

MR. PINK
No, they're not in the car. No, I
don't have them on me. Ya wanna
go with me and get 'em? Yes, we
can go right now. But first
listen to what I'm telling you.
We were fuckin set up! Somebody
is in league with the cops. We
got a Judas in our midst. And I'm
thinkin we should have our fuckin
heads examined for waiting around
here.

MR. WHITE
That was the plan, we meet here.

MR. PINK
Then where is everybody? I say
the plan became null and void once
we found out we got a rat in the
house. We ain't got the slightest
fuckin idea what happened to Mr.
Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could
both be dead
or arrested. They could be
sweatin 'em, down at the station
house right now. Yeah they don't
know the names, but they can sing
about this place.
I mean, that could be happening
right now. As we speak, the cops
could be in their cars, drivin
here this minute.

MR. WHITE
I swear to god I'm fuckin jinxed.

MR. PINK
What?

MR. WHITE
Two jobs back, it was a four man
job, we discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop.

MR. PINK
No shit?

MR. WHITE
Thank god, we discovered in time.
We hadda forget the whole fuckin
thing. Just walked away from it.

MR. PINK
So who's the rat this time? Mr.
Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's
Joe's show, he set this whole
thing up. Maybe he set it up to
set it up.

MR. WHITE
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go
back a long time. I can tell ya
straight up, Joe definitely didn't
have anything to do with this
bullshit.

MR. PINK
Oh, you and Joe go back a long
time. I known Joe since I was a
kid. But me saying Joe definitely
couldn't have done it is
ridiculous. I can say I
definitely didn't do it, cause I
know what I did or didn't do. But
I can't definitely say that about
anybody else, 'cause I don't
definitely know. For all I know,
you're the rat.

MR. WHITE
For all I know, you're the rat.

MR. PINK
Now you're using your head. For
all we know, he's the rat.

Mr. Pink points OFFSCREEN to Mr. Orange. Mr. White's
expression changes.

MR. WHITE
Jesus Christ!


11 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

They run over to Mr. Orange, who's unconscious. The
CAMERA hovers over the action. Mr. Pink reaches him
first.

MR. PINK
Is he dead?

Mr. White pushes him out of the way. He feels the pulse
on Mr. Orange's neck.

MR. PINK
So, is he dead or what?

MR. WHITE
He ain't dead.

MR. PINK
So what is it?

MR. WHITE
I think he's just passed out.

MR. PINK
He scared the fuckin shit outta
me. I thought he was dead fer
sure.

Mr. White stands up and walks over to a table.

MR. WHITE
He will be dead fer sure, if we
don't get him to a hospital.

MR. PINK
We can't take him to a hospital.

MR. WHITE
Without medical attention, this
man won't live through the night.
That bullet in his belly is my
fault. Now while that might not
mean jack shit to you, it means a
helluva lot to me. And I'm not
gonna just sit around and watch
him die.

MR. PINK
Well, first things first, staying
here's goofy. We gotta book up.

MR. WHITE
So what do you suggest, we go to a
hotel? We got a guy who's shot in
the belly, he can't walk, he
bleeds like a stuck pig, and when
he's awake, he screams in pain.

MR. PINK
You gotta idea, spit it out.

MR. WHITE
Joe could help him. If we can get
in touch with Joe, Joe could get
him to a doctor, Joe could get a
doctor to come and see him.

During Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a
C.U. of Mr. White.

MR. PINK (OS)
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we
gonna get in touch with him? He's
supposed to be here, but he ain't,
which is making me nervous about
being here. Even if Joe is
on the up and up, he's probably
not gonna be that happy with us.
Joe planned a robbery, but he's
got a blood bath on his hands now.
Dead cops, dead robbers, dead
civilians...Jesus Christ! I tend
to doubt he's gonna have a lot of
sympathy for our plight. If I was
him, I'd try and put as much
distance between me and this mess
an humanly possible.

MR. WHITE
Before you got here, Mr. Orange
was askin me to take him to a
hospital. Now I don't like
turning him over to the cops, but
if we don't, he's dead. He begged
me to do it. I told him to hold
off till Joe got here.

MR. PINK (OS)
Well Joe ain't gettin here. We're
on our own. Now, I don't know a
goddamn body who can help him, so
if you know somebody, call 'em.

MR. WHITE
I don't know anybody.

MR. PINK (OS)
Well, I guess we drop him off at
the hospital. Since he don't know
nothin about us, I say it's his
decision.


MR. WHITE'S POV:

C.U. OF MR. PINK.

MR. WHITE (OS)
Well, he knows a little about me.

MR. PINK
You didn't tell him your name, did
ya?

MR. WHITE (OS)
I told him my first name, and
where I'm from.

There is a long silence and a blank look from Mr. Pink,
then he SCREAMS:

MR. PINK
Why!

MR. WHITE (OS)
I told him where I was from a few
days ago. It was just a casual
conversation.

MR. PINK
And what was tellin him your name
when you weren't supposed to?

MR. WHITE (OS)
He asked.

Mr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he's retarded.

MR. WHITE (OS)
We had just gotten away from the
cops. He just got shot. It was
my fuckin fault he got shot. He's
a fuckin bloody mess - he's
screaming. I swear to god, I
thought we was gonna die right
then and there. I'm tryin to
comfort him, telling him not to
worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm
gonna take care of him. And he
asked me what my name was. I
mean, the man was dyin in my arms.
What the fuck was I supposed to
tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out
that information, it's against the
rules. I don't trust you
enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I
couldn't.

MR. PINK
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite
beautiful--

MR. WHITE (OS)
Don't fuckin patronize me.

MR. PINK
One question: Do they have a sheet
on you, where you told him you're
from?

MR. WHITE (OS)
Of course.

MR. PINK
Well that's that, then. I mean, I
was worried about mug shot
possibilities already. But now he
knows: (a) what you look like, (b)
what your first name is,
(i) where you're from and (d) what
your specialty is.
They ain't gonna hafta show him a
helluva lot of pictures for him to
pick you out. That's it right,
you didn't tell him anything else
that could narrow down the
selection?

MR. WHITE (OS)
If I have to tell you again to
back off, me an you are gonna go
round and round.

Mr. Pink walks out of the C.U. and turns his back on Mr.
White. Mr. White's POV PANS over to him.

MR. PINK
We ain't taking him to a hospital.

MR. WHITE (OS)
If we don't, he'll die.

MR. PINK
And I'm very sad about that. But
some fellas are lucky, and some
ain't.

MR. WHITE (OS)
That fuckin did it!

Mr. White's POV CHARGES toward Mr. Pink.

Mr. Pink turns toward him in time to get PUNCHED hard in
the mouth.

END OF POV

Mr. White and Mr. Pink have a very ungraceful and
realistic fight. They go at each other like a couple of
alley cats.

As Mr. White SWINGS and PUNCHES, he SCREAMS:

MR. WHITE

You little motherfucker!

Mr. Pink YELLS as he HITS:

MR. PINK
Ya wanna fuck with me?! You wanna
fuck with me?! I'll show you who
you're fuckin with!

The two men end up on the floor KICKING and SCRATCHING.

Mr. White gets Mr. Pink in a HEADLOCK.

Mr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it
out.

Mr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink,
and goes for his own weapon.

The two men are on the floor, on their knees, with their
guns outstretched, aiming at one another.

MR. WHITE
You wanna shoot me, you little
piece of shit? Take a shot!

MR. PINK
Fuck you, White! I didn't create
this situation, I'm just dealin
with it. You're acting like a
first-year fuckin thief. I'm
actin like a professional. They
get him, they can get you, they
get you, they get closer to me,
and that can't happen. And you,
you motherfucker, are looking at
me like it's my fault. I didn't
tell him my name. I didn't tell
him where I was from. I didn't
tell him what I knew better than
to tell him. Fuck, fifteen
minutes ago, you almost told me
your name. You, buddy, are stuck
in a situation you created. So if
you wanna throw bad looks
somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.

Mr. Pink lowers his gun and walks towards White.

MR. PINK
So if you wanna shoot somebody,
put that gun in your mouth and
shoot yourself.

Then from OFF SCREEN we hear:

VOICE (OS)
You kids don't play so rough.
Somebody's gonna start crying.


12 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MEDIUM C.U. ON MR. BLONDE

The Voice belongs to the infamous Mr. Blonde.

Mr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke
and eating a hot dog.

MR. PINK
Mr. Blonde! You okay? We thought
you might've gotten caught. What
happened?

Mr. Blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter
and starts walking around the warehouse, checking the
place out.

He doesn't look at either Mr. Pink or Mr. White, he
just eats his hot dog and sips his coke.

This is making Pink and White nervous as hell. But Mr.
Pink tries to talk through it.

We HANDHOLD follow Mr. Blonde around the warehouse.

MR. PINK
Really, how did you get away?

Mr. Blonde walks the loft. Silent.

MR. PINK
You saw what happened to me,
I found a hole and booked.

Silence.

MR. PINK
Where's Mr. Blue?

Blonde looks in the bathroom.

MR. PINK
We were hopin you two would be
together.

Blonde looks out the window.

MR. PINK
That was the big question we had,
what happened to Mr.
Blue and you?

Blonde walks away from the window.

MR. PINK
We were worried the cops got ya.

Blonde bends down over Mr. Orange.

MR. PINK
He got it in the belly. He's
still alive, but won't be for
long.

MR. WHITE
Enough! You better start talkin
to us, asshole, cause we got shit
we need to talk about. We're
already freaked out, we need you
actin freaky like we need a fuckin
bag on our hip.

Mr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime, then moves
towards them.

MR. BLONDE
So, talk.

MR. WHITE
We think we got a rat in the
house.

MR. PINK
I guarantee we got a rat in the
house.

MR. BLONDE
What would ever make you think
that?

MR. WHITE
Is that supposed to be funny?

MR. PINK
We don't think this place is safe.

MR. WHITE
This place just ain't secure
anymore. We're leaving, and you
should go with us.

MR. BLONDE
Nobody's going anywhere.

Silence takes over the room. Mr. Blonde stops moving.

After a few beats the silence is broken.

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Pink)
Piss on this turd, we're outta
here.

Mr. White turns to leave.

MR. BLONDE
Don't take another step, Mr.
White.

Mr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards
Mr. Blonde.

MR. WHITE
Fuck you, maniac! It's your
fuckin fault we're in so much
trouble.

Mr. Blonde calmly sits down. He looks to Mr. Pink.

MR. BLONDE
(referring to Mr.
White)
What's this guy's problem?

MR. WHITE
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta
problem. I gotta big problem with
any trigger-happy madman who
almost gets me shot!

MR. BLONDE
What're you talkin about?

MR. WHITE
That fuckin shooting spree in the
store.

MR. BLONDE
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm,
they deserve what they got.

MR. WHITE
You almost killed me, asshole! If
I had any idea what type of guy
you were, I never would've agreed
to work with you.

MR. BLONDE
You gonna back all day, little
doggie, or are you gonna bite?

MR. WHITE
What was that? I'm sorry, I
didn't catch it. Would you repeat
it?

MR. BLONDE
(slowly)
I said: "Are you gonna bark all
day, dog, or are you gonna bite."

MR. PINK
Both of you two assholes knock it
the fuck off and calm down!

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Blonde)
So you wanna git bit, huh?

MR. PINK
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a
fuckin playground!
(pause)
I don't believe this shit, both of
you got ten years on me, and I'm
the only one actin like a
professional. You guys act like a
bunch of fuckin niggers. You ever
work a job with a bunch of
niggers? They're just like you
two, always fightin, always sayin
they're gonna kill one another.

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Pink)
You said yourself, you
thought about takin him out.

MR. PINK
Then. That time has passed.
Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only
one I completely trust. He's too
fuckin homicidal to be workin with
the cops.

MR. WHITE
You takin his side?

MR. PINK
Fuck sides! What we need is a
little solidarity here.
Somebody's stickin a red hot poker
up our asses and we gotta find out
whose hand's on the handle. Now I
know I'm no piece of shit...
(referring to Mr.
White)
And I'm pretty sure you're a good
boy...
(referring to Mr.
Blonde)
And I'm fuckin positive you're on
the level. So let's figure out
who's the bad guy.

Mr. White calms down and puts his gun away.

Mr. Blonde returns to the persona we saw at the beginning,
talking about Madonna.

MR. BLONDE
Well, that was sure exciting.
(to Mr. White)
You're a big Lee Marvin fan,
aren't you? Me too. I don't know
about the rest of you fellas, but
my heart's
beatin fast.
(pause for a beat)
Okay you guys, follow me.

Mr. Blonde hops out of his chair and heads for the door.

The other two men just follow him with their eyes.

MR. WHITE
Follow you where?

MR. BLONDE
Down to my car.

MR. WHITE
Why?

MR. BLONDE
It's a surprise.

Mr. Blonde walks out.


13 EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

Three cars are parked out front. Mr. Blonde is walking
towards the car he drove. Mr. White and Mr. Pink are
walking behind. The Camera is HANDHELD following behind
them.

MR. PINK
We still gotta get out of here.

MR. BLONDE
We're gonna sit here and wait.

MR. WHITE
For what, the cops?

MR. BLONDE
Nice Guy Eddie.

MR. PINK
Nice Guy Eddie? What makes you
think Nice Guy's anywhere but on a
plane half way to Costa Rica?

MR. BLONDE
Cause I just talked to him. He's
on his way down here, and nobody's
going anywhere till be gets here.

MR. WHITE
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why
the fuck didn't you say that in
the first place?

MR. BLONDE
You didn't ask.

MR. WHITE
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he
say?

MR. BLONDE
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a
look at the little surprise I
brought you.

Mr. Blonde opens up the truck of his car. A handcuffed,
uniformed POLICEMAN is curled up inside the trunk.

MR. BLONDE
So while we're waitin for Nice Guy
Eddie, what say we have a little
fun finding out who the rat is.


INSERT: TITLE CARD "MR. BLONDE".


14 INT. JOE CABOT'S OFFICE - DAY

We're inside the office of Joe Cabot. Joe's on the phone,
sitting behind his desk.

JOE
(into phone)
Sid, I'm tellin you don't worry
about it. You had a bad couple of
months, it happens.
(pause)
Sid, Sid, Sid...Stop, you're
embarrassing me. I don't need to
be told what I already know. When
you have bad months, you do what
every business man in the
worlds does, I don't care if he's
Donald Trump or Irving the tailor.
Ya ride it out.

There's a KNOCK on Cabot's office door.

JOE
Come in.

One of Cabot's goons, TEDDY, opens the door and steps
inside. Cabot covers the receiver with his hand and looks
towards the man.

TEDDY
Vic Vega's outside.

JOE
Tell him to come in.

Teddy leaves.

JOE
(into phone)
Sid, a friend of mine's here. I
gotta go.
(pause)
Good enough, bye.

He hangs up the phone, stands, and walks around to the
front of the desk.

Teddy opens the office door, and TOOTHPICK VIC VEGA walks
in.

Toothpick Vic Vega is none other than our very own Mr.
Blonde. Vic is dressed in a long black leather seventies
style jacket.

Joe stands in front of his desk with his arms open.

The two men embrace each other. Teddy leaves, closing the
door behind him.

JOE
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin
good, ain't it?

VIC
It's a change.

JOE
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy
Martin?

VIC
Sure.

JOE
Take a seat.

Joe goes over to his liquor cabinet. Vic sits in a chair
set in front of Joe's desk.

JOE
(while he pours the
drink)
Who's your parole officer?

VIC
A guy named Koons. Craig Koons.

JOE
How is he?

VIC
Fuckin asshole, won't let me leave
the halfway house.

JOE
Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin
jungle bunny goes out there, slits
some old woman's throat for
twenty-five cents. Fuckin nigger
gets Doris Day as a parole
officer. But a good fella like
you gets stuck with a ball-bustin
prick.

Joe walks back around his desk and sits in his chair.

Vic swallows some Remy.

VIC
I just want you to know, Joe, how
much I appreciate your care
packages on the inside.

JOE
What the hell did you expect me to
do? Just forget about you?

VIC
I just wanted you to know, they
meant a lot.

JOE
It's the least I could do Vic. I
wish I coulda done more.
(Joe flashes a side
grin at Vic)
Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a
story? What're your plans?

VIC
Well, what I wanna do is go back
to work. But I got this Koons
prick deep up my ass. He won't
let me leave the halfway house
till I get some piece of shit job.
My plans have always been to be
part of the team again.

There's a KNOCK at the door.

JOE
Come in.

The door opens and in walks Joe's son, Nice Guy Eddie.
Vic turns around in his seat and sees him.

EDDIE
(to Vic)
I see ya sittin here, but I don't
believe it.

Vic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie.

EDDIE
How ya doin, Toothpick?

VIC
Fine, now.

EDDIE
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked
you up personally at the pen.
This whole week's just been crazy.
I've had my head up my ass the
entire time.

VIC
Funny you should mention it.
That's what your father and I been
talkin about.

EDDIE
That I should've picked you up?

VIC
No. That your head's been up your
ass. I walk through the door and
Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank
god. Finally somebody who knows
what the fuck he's doing. Vic,
Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck
up." And I say "Well, Joe, I
coulda told you that." "I'm
ruined! He's ruining me! My son,
I love him, but he's taking my
business and flushing it down the
fuckin toilet!"
(to Joe)
I'm not tellin tales out of
school. You tell 'im Joe.
Tell 'im yourself.

JOE
Eddie, I hate like hell for you to
hear it this way. But when Vic
asked me how's business, well, you
don't lie to a man who's just done
four years in the slammer for ya.

Eddie bobs his head up and down.

EDDIE
Oh really, is that a fact?

Eddie JUMPS Vic and they fall to the floor.

The two friends, laughing and cussing at each other,
wrestle on the floor of Joe's office.

Joe's on his feet yelling at them.

JOE
(yelling)
Okay, okay, enough, enough!
Playtime's over! You wanna roll
around on the floor, do it in
Eddie's office, not mine!

The two men break it up. They are completely disheveled,
hair a mess, shirttails out. As they get themselves
together, they continue to taunt one another.

EDDIE
Daddy, did ya see that?

JOE
What?

EDDIE
Guy got me on the ground, tried to
fuck me.

VIC
You fuckin wish.

EDDIE
You tried to fuck me in my
father's office, you sick bastard.
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do
in the privacy of your own home,
go do it. But don't try to fuck
me. I don't think of you that
way. I mean, I like you a lot--

VIC
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I
wouldn't throw you to the crew.

EDDIE
No, you'd keep me for yourself.
Four years fuckin punks in the ass
made you appreciate prime rib when
you get it.

VIC
I might break you, Nice Guy, but
I'd make you my dog's bitch.
You'd be suckin the dick and going
down on a mangy T-bone hound.

EDDIE
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy,
walks into jail a white man, walks
out talkin like a nigger. It's
all that black semen been shootin
up his butt. It's backed up into
his brain and comes out of his
mouth.

JOE
Are you two finished? We were
talkin about some serious shit
when you came in Eddie. We got a
big problem we're tryin to solve.
Now Eddie, would you like to sit
down and help us solve it, or do
you two wanna piss fart around?

Playtime is over and Vic and Eddie know it. So they both
take seats in front of Joe's desk.

JOE
Now Vic was tellin me, he's got a
parole problem.

EDDIE
Really? Who's your P.O.?

VIC
Craig Koons.

EDDIE
Koons? Oh shit, I hear he's a
motherfucker.

VIC
He is a motherfucker. He won't
let me leave the halfway house
till I get some piece of shit job.

EDDIE
You're coming back to work for us,
right?

VIC
I wanna. But I gotta show this
asshole I got an honest-to-
goodness job before he'll let me
move out on my own. I can't work
for you guys and be worried about
gettin back before ten o'clock
curfew.

JOE
(to Eddie)
We can work this out, can't we?

EDDIE
This isn't all that bad. We can
give you a lot of legitimate jobs.
Put you on the rotation at Long
Beach as a dock worker.

VIC
I don't wanna lift crates.

EDDIE
You don't hafta lift shit. You
don't really work there. But as
far as the records are concerned,
you do. I call up Matthews, the
foreman, tell him he's got a new
guy. You're on the schedule. You
got a timecard, it's clocked in
and out for you everyday, and you
get a pay check at the end of the
week. And ya know dock workers
don't do too bad. So you can move
into a halfway decent place
without Koons thinkin "what the
fuck." And if Koons ever wants to
make a surprise visit, you're gone
that day. That day we sent you to
Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit
you needed to unload there.
You're at the Taft airstrip pickin
up a bunch of shit and bringing it
back. Part of your jab is goin
different places - and we got
places all over the place.

JOE
(to Vic)
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?
(to Eddie)
Vic was worried.

EDDIE
Me and you'll drive down to Long
Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce
you to Matthews, tell him what's
going on.

VIC
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.
(pause)
When do you think you'll need me
for real work?

JOE
Well, it's kinda a strange time
right now. Things are kinda--

EDDIE
--Nuts. We got a big meeting in
Vegas coming up. And we're kinda
just gettin ready for that right
now.

JOE
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long
Beach. Give ya some cash, get
that Koons fuck off your back, and
we'll be talking to ya.

EDDIE
Daddy, I got an idea. Now just
hear it out. I know you don't
like to use any of the boys on
these jobs, but technically, Vic
ain't one of the boys. He's been
gone for four years. He ain't on
no one's list. Ya know he can
handle himself, ya know you can
trust him.

Joe looks at Vic.

Vic has no idea what they're talking about.

JOE
How would you feel about pullin a
heist with about five other guys?

VIC
What's the exposure like?

JOE
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough
two minutes. It's a hold up,
daylight, during business hours,
dealing with a crowd. But you
have the fellas to deal with the
crowd. It's a jewelry store.
They're getting a big shipment of
South African diamonds on a
certain day. They're like a way
station. It's gonna get picked up
the next day and sent to Hamburg.
When you walk through the door,
you'll know right where to go for
the rich stones.
The fellas are good, me and Nice
Guy picked em. Nobody knows
anybody else. Nobody's connected.
I don't use connected guys for
this shit.

VIC
What's the cut?

JOE
Juicy, man, real juicy.

Toothpick Vic smiles.

So does Nice Guy Eddie.

CUT TO:


15 INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Nice Guy Eddie is driving to the rendezvous talking on his
portable car phone. The sounds of the seventies are
coming out of his car radio in the form of "Love Goes
Where My Rosemary Goes" by Edison Lighthouse.

EDDIE
(into phone)
Hey Dov, we got a major situation
here.
(pause)
I know you know that. I gotta
talk with daddy and find out what
he wants done.


FLASH ON

16 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The Cop is standing in the warehouse with his hands cuffed
behind his back. Mr. White, Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde
surround him and proceed to beat the shit out of him.
"Love Grows .." PLAYS over the soundtrack.


17 BACK TO NICE GUY EDDIE

EDDIE
(into phone)
All I know is what Vic told me.
He said the place turned into a
fuckin bullet festival. He took a
cop as hostage, just to get the
fuck out of there.


FLASH ON

18 WAREHOUSE

The three men are stomping the cop into the ground.


19 BACK TO EDDIE

EDDIE
(into phone)
Do I sound like I'm jokin? He's
fuckin driving around with the cop
in his trunk.
(pause)
I don't know who did that. I
don't know who has the loot, if
anybody has the loot. Who's dead,
who's alive, who's caught, who's
not...
I will know, I'm practically
there. But what do I tell these
guys about daddy?
(pause)
You sure that's what he said?
(pause)
Okay, that's what I'll tell em.

CUT TO:


20 EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

Three cars belonging to the other guys are parked outside
the warehouse.

Eddie drives his car up to the warehouse. He gets out of
the car, looks at the other cars parked outside.

EDDIE
(to himself)
Fucking assholes.

Eddie makes a beeline for the front door, BANGS it open,
and steps inside the warehouse.


21 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The robbers have the cop tied to a chair and are still
WAILING on him.

Nice Guy Eddie walks in and everybody jumps.

EDDIE
What in Sam Hill is goin on?

Mr. Pink and Mr. White speak together.

MR. PINK MR. WHITE
Hey, Nice Guy, we got a You're askin what's goin
cop. on? Where the fuck is
Joe?

Nice Guy sees Mr. Orange.

EDDIE
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked
up!

MR. WHITE
No shit, he's gonna fuckin die on
us if we don't get him taken care
of.

MR. PINK
We were set up, the cops were
waiting for us.

EDDIE
What? Nobody set anybody up.

MR. PINK
The cops were there waitin for us!

EDDIE
Bullshit.

MR. PINK
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't
there, we were. And I'm tellin
ya, the cops had that store staked
out.

EDDIE
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?

MR. PINK
What the fuck d'you think we've
been askin each other?

EDDIE
And what are your answers? Was it
me? You think I set you up?

MR. PINK
I don't know, but somebody did.

EDDIE
Nobody did. You assholes turn the
jewelry store into a wild west
show, and you wonder why cops show
up.

MR. BLONDE
Where's Joseph?

EDDIE
I ain't talked to him. I talked
to Dov. Dov said he's comin out
here, and he's fucking pissed.

MR. PINK
(to Mr. White)
I told ya he'd be pissed.

MR. WHITE
(pointing to Mr.
Orange)
What are you gonna do about him?

EDDIE
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin
chance to breathe. I got a few
questions of my own, ya know.

MR. WHITE
You ain't dying, he is.

EDDIE
I'll call somebody.

MR. WHITE
Who?

EDDIE
A snake charmer, what the fuck
d'you think. I'll call a doctor,
take care of him, fix 'm right up.
No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr.
Blue?

MR. PINK
Brown's dead, we don't know about
Blue.

EDDIE
Nobody saw what happened to Mr.
Blue?

MR. BLONDE
Well, he's either dead or he's
alive or the cops got him or they
don't.

DOLLY to MEDIUM on the cop.

EDDIE (OS)
I take it this is the bastard you
told me about.
(referring to the
cop)
Why the hell are you beating on
him?

MR. PINK
So he'll tell us who the fuck set
us up.

EDDIE
Would you stop it with that shit!
You beat on this prick enough,
he'll tell ya he started the
Chicago fire. That don't
necessarily make it so. Okay,
first things fucking last, where's
the shit? Please tell me somebody
brought something
with them.

MR. PINK
I got a bag. I stashed it till I
could be sure this place wasn't a
police station.

EDDIE
Well, let's go get it. We also
gotta get rid of all those cars.
It looks like Sam's hot car lot
outside.
(pointing to Mr.
Blonde)
You stay here and babysit Orange
and the cop.
(referring to Mr.
Pink and Mr. White)
You two take a car each, I'll
follow ya. You ditch it, I'll
pick you up, then we'll pick up
the stones. And while I'm
following you, I'll arrange for
some sort of a doctor for our
friend.

MR. WHITE
We can't leave these guys with
him.

Meaning Mr. Blonde.

EDDIE
Why not?

Mr. White crosses to Mr. Blonde.

MR. WHITE
Because this guy's a fucking
psycho. And if you think
Joe's pissed at us, that
ain't nothing compared to how
pissed off I am at him, for puttin
me in the same room as this
bastard.

MR. BLONDE
(to Eddie)
You see what I been puttin up
with? As soon as I walk through
the door I'm hit with this shit.
I tell 'm what you told me about
us stayin put and Mr. White whips
out his gun, sticks it in my face,
and starts screaming "You
motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you
away, blah, blah, blah."

MR. WHITE
He's the reason the place turned
into a shooting gallery.
(to Mr. Pink)
What are you, a silent partner?
Fuckin tell him.

MR. PINK
He seems all right now, but he
went crazy in the store.

MR. WHITE
This is what he was doin.

Mr. White acts out Mr. Blonde shooting everybody in the
store.

MR. BLONDE
I told 'em not to touch the alarm.
They touched it. I blew 'em full
of holes. If they hadn't done
what I told 'em not it, they'd
still be alive.

MR. WHITE
That's your excuse for going on a
kill crazy rampage?

MR. BLONDE
I don't like alarms.

EDDIE
What does it matter who stays with
the cop? We ain't lettin him go.
Not after he's seen everybody.
You should've never took him outta
your trunk in the first place.

MR. PINK
We were trying to find out what he
knew about the set up.

EDDIE
There is no fuckin set up!
(Eddie takes charge)
Look, this is the news. Blondie,
you stay here and take care of
them two. White and Pink come
with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and
sees all those fucking cars
parked out front, he's going to be
as mad at me as he is at you.

Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk out of the warehouse
talking amongst themselves.


22 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MR. BLONDE AND COP

Mr. Blonde closes the door after them. He then slowly
turns his head towards the cop.

MR. BLONDE
Alone at last.


C.U. COP'S FACE.

MR. BLONDE (OS)
Now where were we?

COP
I told you I don't know anything
about any fucking set up. I've
only been on the force eight
months, nobody tells me anything!
I don't know anything! You can
torture me if you want--

MR. BLONDE (OS)
--Thanks, don't mind if I do.

COP
Your boss even said there wasn't a
set up.

MR. BLONDE (OS)
First off, I don't have a boss.
Are you clear about that?

He SLAPS the cop's face.

MR. BLONDE (OS)
I asked you a question. Are you
clear about that?

COP
Yes.

MR. BLONDE (OS)
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I
don't really care about what you
know or don't know. I'm gonna
torture you for awhile regardless.
Not to get information, but
because torturing a cop amuses me.
There's nothing you can say,
there's nothing you can do.
Except pray for death.

He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth.


COP'S POV

Mr. Blonde walks away from the cop.

MR. BLONDE
Let's see what's on K-BILLY'S
"super sounds of the seventies"
weekend.

He turns on the radio.

Stealer's Wheel's hit "Stuck in the Middle with You" PLAYS
over the speaker.

NOTE: This entire sequence is timed to the music.

Mr. Blonde slowly walks toward the cop.

He opens a large knife.

He grabs a chair, places it in front of the cop and sits
in it.

Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, holding
the knife, singing along with the song.

Then, like a cobra, he LASHES out.

A SLASH across the face.

The cop/camera moves around wildly.

Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, singing
along with the seventies hit.

Then he reaches out and CUTS OFF the cop's/our ear.

The cop/camera moves around wildly.

Mr. Blonde holds the ear up to the cop/us to see.

Mr. Blonde rises, kicking the chair he was sitting on out
of the way.


23 INT./EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - HANDHELD SHOT

We follow Mr Blonde as he walks out of the warehouse...

...to his car. He opens the trunk, pulls out a large can
of gasoline.

He walks back inside the warehouse...


24 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

...carrying the can of gas.

Mr. Blonde POURS the gasoline all over the cop, who's
BEGGING him not to do this.

Mr. Blonde just sings along with Stealer's Wheel.

Mr. Blonde LIGHTS up a match and, while mouthing:

MR. BLONDE
"Clowns to the left of me,
Jokers to the right. Here I am,
stuck in the middle with you."

He moves the match up to the cop...

...When a bullet EXPLODES in Mr. Blonde's chest.

The HANDHELD camera WHIPS to the right and we see the
bloody Mr. Orange FIRING his gun.

We cut back and forth between Mr. Blonde taking BULLET
HITS and Mr. Orange emptying his weapon.

Mr. Blonde FALLS down dead.

Mr. Orange crawls to where the cop is, leaving a bloody
trail behind him.

When he reaches the cop's feet he looks up at him.

MR. ORANGE
(feebly)
What's your name?

COP
Jeffrey.

MR. ORANGE
Jeffrey what?

COP
Jeffrey Andrews.

MR. ORANGE
Listen to me, Jeffrey
Andrews. I'm a cop.

JEFFREY
I know.

MR. ORANGE
(surprised)
You do?

JEFFREY
Your name's Freddy something.

MR. ORANGE
Freddy Newendyke.

JEFFREY
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us
once, about five months ago.

MR. ORANGE
Shit. I don't remember that at
all.

JEFFREY
I do.
(pause)
How do I look?

The gun-shot Mr. Orange looks at the kid's GASHED face and
the hole in the side of his head where his ear used to be.

MR. ORANGE
I don't know what to tell you
Jeffrey.

Jeffrey starts to weep.

JEFFREY
That fucking bastard! That
fucking sick fucking bastard!

MR. ORANGE
Jeffrey, I need you to hold on.
There's officers positioned and
waiting to move in a block away.

JEFFREY
(screaming)
What the fuck are they waiting
for? That motherfucker cut off my
ear! He slashed my face! I'm
deformed!

MR. ORANGE
And I'm dying. They don't know
that. All they know is they're
not to make a move until Joe Cabot
shows up. I was sent undercover
to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they
said he's on his way. Don't pussy
out on me now, Jeffrey. We're
just gonna sit here and bleed
until Joe
Cabot sticks his fuckin head
through that door.

CUT TO:


INSERT: TITLE CARD "MR. ORANGE & MR. WHITE"


25 INT. DENNY'S - NIGHT

A tough-looking black man named HOLDAWAY, who sports a
Malcom X beard, a green Chairman Mao cap with a red star
on it, and a military flack jacket, digs into a Denny
bacon, cheese and avocado burger. He sits in a booth all
alone. He's waiting for somebody. As he waits, he
practically empties an entire bottle of ketchup on his
french fries, not by mistake either--that's just how he
likes it.

We see Mr. Orange, now known as FREDDY NEWENDYKE, wearing
a high school letterman jacket, enter the coffee shop,
spot Holdaway, and head his way. Holdaway sees Freddy bop
towards him with a wide-ass alligator grin plastered
across his face.

CAMERA DOLLIES FAST down AISLE to MEDIUM SHOT of Holdaway.
We fear Freddy OFF SCREEN.

FREDDY (O.S.)
Say "hello" to a motherfucker
who's inside. Cabot's doing a job
and take a big fat guess who he
wants on the team?

HOLDAWAY
This better not be some Freddy
joke.

LOW ANGLE

looking up at Freddy, who's standing at the table.

FREDDY
It ain't no joke, I'm in there.
I'm up his ass.

CU ON HOLDAWAY

Holdaway just looks at his pupil for a moment, then
smiles.

HOLDAWAY
Congratulations.


26 EXT. DENNY'S - NIGHT

We see through the window of the restaurant Freddy slide
into the booth across from Holdaway. Freddy's doing a lot
of talking, but we can't hear what they're saying.


27 INT. DENNY'S - NIGHT

FREEZE FRAME ON HOLDAWAY

We are frozen on a MEDIUM CU of Holdaway listening to
Freddy. We HEAR RESTAURANT NOISE and Freddy OFF SCREEN.

FREDDY (O.S.)
Nice Guy Eddie tells me Joe wants
to meet me. He says I should just
hang around my apartment and wait
for a phone call. Well after
waiting three goddamn days by the
fuckin phone, he calls me last
night and says Joe's ready, and
he'll pick me up in fifteen
minutes.

The freeze frame ENDS. Holdaway comes suddenly up to
speed and says:

HOLDAWAY
Woo all picked you up?

From here to end we cut back and forth.

FREDDY
Nice Guy. When we got to the
bar...

HOLDAWAY
...What bar?

FREDDY
The Boots and Socks in Gardena.
When we got there, I met Joe and a
guy named Mr. White. It's a phony
name. My name's Mr. Orange.

HOLDAWAY
You ever seen this motherfucker
before?

FREDDY
Who, Mr. White?

HOLDAWAY
Yeah.

FREDDY
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't
one of Cabot's soldiers either.
He's gotta be from outta town.
But Joe knows him real well.

HOLDAWAY
How can you tell?

FREDDY
The way they talk to each other.
You can tell they're buddies.

HOLDAWAY
Did the two of you talk?

FREDDY
Me and Mr. White?

HOLDAWAY
Yeah.

FREDDY
A little.

HOLDAWAY
What about?

FREDDY
The Brewers.

HOLDAWAY
The Milwaukee Brewers?

FREDDY
Yeah. They had just won the night
before, and he made a killing off
'em.

HOLDAWAY
Well, if this crook's a Brewers
fan, his ass has gotta be from
Wisconsin. And I'll bet you
everything from a diddle-eyed Joe
to a damned-if-I-know, that in
Milwaukee they got a sheet on this
Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I
want you to go through the mugs of
guys from old Milwaukee with a
history of armed robbery, and put
a name to that face.

Holdaway takes a big bite out of his burger.

HOLDAWAY
(with his mouth full)
What kinds questions did Cabot
ask?

FREDDY
Where I was from, who I knew, how
I knew Nice Guy, had I done time,
shit like that.

Holdaway's talked enough, he's eating his burger now. He
motions for Freddy to elaborate.

FREDDY
He asked me if I ever done armed
robbery before. I read him my
credits. I robbed a few gas and
sips, sold some weed, told him
recently I held the shotgun while
me and another guy pulled down a
poker game in Portland.

CAMERA MOVES from a MEDIUM on Freddy to a CU.

HOLDAWAY (O.S.)
Didja use the commode story?

FREDDY
Fuckin-A. I tell it real good,
too.


28 INT. MEN'S ROOM - L.A. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

Freddy and Holdaway at one of their many rendezvous.
Holdaway wears an extra large Lakers sweatshirt. Freddy
sits on one of the sinks, wearing his high school jacket,
looking at pieces of paper stapled together.

FREDDY
What's this?

HOLDAWAY
It's a scene. Memorize it.

FREDDY
What?

HOLDAWAY
A undercover cop has got to be
Marlon Brando. To do this job you
got to be a great actor. You got
to be naturalistic. You got to be
naturalistic as hell. If you
ain't a great actor you're a bad
actor, and bad acting is bull shit
in this job.

FREDDY
(referring to the
papers)
But what is this?

HOLDAWAY
It's a amusing anecdote about a
drug deal.

FREDDY
What?

HOLDAWAY
Something funny that happened to
you while you were doing a job.

FREDDY
I gotta memorize all this shit?

HOLDAWAY
It's like a joke. You remember
what's important, and the rest you
make your own. The only way to
make it your own is to keep sayin
it, and sayin it, and sayin it,
and sayin it, and sayin it.

FREDDY
I can do that.

HOLDAWAY
The things you gotta remember are
the details. It's the details
that sell your story. Now this
story takes place in this men's
room. So you gotta know the
details about this men's room.
You gotta know they got a blower
instead of a towel to dry your
hands. You gotta know the stalls
ain't got no doors. You gotta
know whether they got liquid or
powdered soap, whether they got
hot water or not, 'cause if you do
your job when you tell your story,
everybody should believe it. And
if you tell your story to somebody
who's actually taken a piss in
this men's room, and you get one
detail they remember right,
they'll swear by you.


29 INT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Freddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame,
rehearsing the anecdote. He's reading it pretty good, but
he's still reading it from the page, and every once in a
while he stumbles over his words.

FREDDY
...this was during the Los Angeles
marijuana drought of '86. I still
had a connection. Which was
insane, 'cause you couldn't get
weed anyfuckinwhere then. Anyway,
I had a connection with this
hippie chick up in Santa Cruz.
All and my friends knew it. And
they'd give me a call and say,
"Hey, Freddy, you buyin some, you
think you could buy me some too?"
They knew I smoked, so they'd ask
me to buy a little for them when I
was buyin. But it got to be
everytime I bought some weed, I
was buyin for four or five
different people. Finally I said,
"Fuck this shit." I'm makin this
bitch rich. She didn't have to do
jack shit, she never even had to
meet these people. I was fuckin
doin all the work. So I got
together with her and told her,
"Hey, I'm sick of this shit. I'm
comin through for everybody, and
nobody's comin through for me.
So, either I'm gonna tell all my
friends to find their own source,
or you give me a bunch of weed,
I'll sell it to them, give you the
money, minus ten percent, and I
get my pot for free." So, I did
if for awhile...

Freddy exits frame

CUT TO:


30 EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Another empty frame, except obviously outside. Freddy
enters frame from the same direction he exited in the
previous scene, finishing his sentence. When we move to a
wider shot we see Freddy performing his monolog to
Holdaway in a parking lot. Holdaway sits on the hood of
his beat-up car. Freddy paces back and forth as he
performs his story.

FREDDY
...but then that got to be a pain
in the ass. People called me on
the phone all the fuckin time. I
couldn't rent a fuckin tape
without six phone calls
interrupting me. "Hey, Freddy,
when's the next time you're gettin
some?" "Motherfucker, I'm tryin
to watch 'Lost Boys'-- when I have
some, I'll let you know." And
then these rinky-dink pot heads
come by--there's my friends and
everything, but still. I got all
my shit laid out in sixty dollar
bags. Well, they don't want sixty
dollars worth. They want ten
dollars worth. Breaking it up is
a major fuckin pain in the ass. I
don't even know how much ten
dollars worth is. "Well, fuck,
man, I don't want that much
around. If I have that much
around I'll smoke it." "Hey, if
you guys can't control your
smokin, that's not my problem.
You motherfuckers been smokin for
five years, be a adult about it."
Finally I just told my connection,
count me out. But as it turns
out, I'm the best guy she had, and
she depended alot on my business.
But I was still sick to death of
it. And she's trying to talk me
into not quitin.
Now this was a very weird
situation, 'cause I don't know if
you remember back in '86, there
was a major fuckin drought.
Nobody and anything. People were
livin on resin and smokin the wood
in their pipes for months. And
this chick had a bunch, and was
beggin me to sell it. So I told
her I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot
Man anymore. But I would take a
little bit and sell it to my
close, close, close friends. She
agreed to that, and said we'd keep
the same arrangement as before,
ten percent and free pot for me,
as long as I helped her out that
weekend. She had a brick of weed
she was sellin, and she didn't
want to go to the buy alone...

CUT TO:


31 INT. BOOTS AND SOCKS BAR - NIGHT

Freddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie and Mr. White all sit around a
table in a red-lighted smokey bar. Freddy continues his
story. The crooks are enjoying the hell out of it.

FREDDY
...Her brother usually goes with
her, but he's in county
unexpectedly.

MR. WHITE
What for?

FREDDY
Traffic tickets gone to warrant.
They stopped him for something,
found the warrants on 'im, took
'im to jail. She doesn't want to
walk around alone with all that
weed. Well, I don't wanna do
this, I have a bad feeling about
it, but she keeps askin me, keeps
askin me, finally I said okay
'cause I'm sick of listening to
it. Well, we're picking this guy
up at the train station.

JOE
You're picking the buyer up at the
train station? You're carrying
the weed on you?

FREDDY
Yeah, the guy needed it right
away. Don't ask me why. So we
get to the train station, and
we're waitin for the guy. Now I'm
carrying the weed in one of those
carry-on bags, and I gotta take a
piss. So I tell the connection
I'll be right back, I'm goin' to
the little boys room...

32 INT. MEN'S ROOM - TRAIN STATION - DAY

MEDIUM ON FREDDY

He walks through the door with a carry-on bag over his
shoulder. Once he's inside, he stops in his tracks. We
move into a CU.

FREDDY (V.O.)
...So I walk into the men's room,
and who's standing there?

FREEZE FRAME

on Freddy standing in front of six Los Angeles County
Sheriffs and one German Shepherd. All of their eyes are
on Freddy. Everyone is frozen.

FREDDY (V.O.)
...six Los Angeles County Sheriffs
and a German Shepherd.

NICE GUY EDDIE (V.O.)
They were waiting for you?

FREDDY (V.O.)
No. They were just a bunch of
cops hangin out in the men's room,
talkin. When I walked through the
door they all stopped what they
were talking about and looked at
me.


33 BACK TO BAR

ECU MR. WHITE

MR. WHITE
That's hard, man. That's a fuckin
hard situation.


34 BACK TO MEN'S ROOM

ECU GERMAN SHEPHERD

barking his head off.

FREDDY (V.O.)
The German Shepherd starts
barkin'. He's barkin' at me. I
mean it's obvious he's barkin' at
me.

We do a slow 360 around Freddy in the men's room. We can
hear the dog barking.

FREDDY (V.O.)
Every nerve ending, all of my
senses, the blood in my veins,
everything I has was screaming,
"Take off, man, just take off, get
the fuck outta there!" Panic hit
me like a bucket of water. First
there was the shock of it--BAM,
right in the face! Then I'm just
standin there drenched in panic.

SLOW MOTION

CAMERA does a PAN from face to face of the sheriffs.

FREDDY (V.O.)
And all those sheriffs are lookin
at me and they know. They can
smell it. As sure as that fuckin
dog cam, they can smell it on me.

FREEZE FRAME

Back to the same freeze frame shot of Freddy standing in
front of the sheriffs. It suddenly jerks to life, and
moves to speed. The dog is barking. Freddy moves to his
right, out of frame. We stay on the sheriffs. One
sheriff yells at the dog.

SHERIFF #1
Shut up!

The dog quiets down. Sheriff #2 continues with his story.
A couple of the sheriffs look over at Freddy off screen,
but as Sheriff #2 talks, turn their attention to him.

SHERIFF #2
So my gun's drawn, right? I got
it aimed right at him. I tell
'em, "Freeze, don't fuckin move."
And the little idiot's lookin at
me, nodding his head "Yes," sayin
"I know...I know...I know."
Meanwhile his right hand is
creepin towards his glove box. So
I scream at him, "Asshole, you
better fuckin freeze right now!"
And he's still lookin right at me,
saying
"I know...I know...I know." And
his right hand's still going for
the glove box.

The CAMERA PANS away from the sheriffs to Freddy, up
against the urinal, playing possum, pretending to piss.

SHERIFF #2 (O.S.)
I tell 'im, "Buddy, I'm gonna
shoot you in the face right now if
you don't put your hands on the
fuckin dash." And the guy's
girlfriend, a real sexy Oriental
bitch, starts screamin at him,
"Chuck, are you out of your mind?
Put your hands on the dash like
the officer said." And then like
nothing, the guy snaps out of it
and casually puts his hands on the
dash.

Freddy finishes his playing possum piss, and walks past
the sheriffs over to the sink. The CAMERA PANS with him.
A sheriff is sitting on a sink. He looks down and watches
Freddy wash his hands.

SHERIFF #1
What was he goin for?

SHERIFF #2
His registration. Stupid fuckin
citizen, doesn't have the
slightest idea how close he came
to gettin shot.

Freddy finishes washing his hands. He goes to dry them,
but there's only those hand drying machines. Freddy turns
on the drying machine. He can't hear anything the
sheriffs say now. The sound of the machine dominates the
sound track.

These following shots are SLOW MOTION.

FULL SCENE

An office upstairs in the undercover division of the
police station.


TWO SHOT OF FREDDY AND HOLDAWAY

look at mug shot.

HOLDAWAY
Lawrence Dimick. Let's see what
we got on him.

CU OF COMPUTER SCREEN

the name DIMICK, LAWRENCE is typed in.


C.U. ENTER BUTTON IS PRESSED


C.U. OF FEMALE COMPUTER OPERATOR, JODIE SEIGEL.

JODIE
This is your life, Lawrence
Dimick!


C.U. OF COMPUTER PRINTER

over the soundtrack. Jodie's hand comes into FRAME and
tears sheet from the printer.

36 INT. HOLDAWAY'S OFFICE - DAY

Holdaway sits behind his desk. Freddy sits on the edge of
the desk eating a Double-Double with cheese. They look
into the CAMERA.

We hear Jodie's voice OFFSCREEN.

JODIE (OS)
Lawrence "Larry" Dimick. Also
known as Lawrence Jacobs and Alvin
"Al" Jacobs. This guy is Mr. Joe-
Armed-Robbery. He's
a pro and he makes it a habit not
to get caught.


MEDIUM SHOT OF JODIE

DOLLY slowly into C.U.

JODIE
He's only been convicted twice,
which is pretty good for somebody
living a life of crime. Once for
armed robbery, when he was twenty-
one, in Milwaukee.


C.U. FREDDY

FREDDY
What was it?


JODIE

JODIE
Payroll office at a lumber yard.
First offense - he got eighteen
months. He didn't get busted
again until he was thirty-two.
And then it was a backdoor bust.
A routine vice squad roust. They
roust this bar, out buddy Lawrence
is in there knocking down a few.
He gets picked up. He's wearing
on his person an outlaw .45
automatic, apparently his weapon
of choice. Also, on his finger is
a diamond ring from a jewelry
store robbery a year earlier. He
got two years back inside for
that.


TWO SHOT OF HOLDAWAY AND FREDDY

Freddy winces.

FREDDY
Goddamn, that's hard time.


JODIE

JODIE
So far, it's the only time he's
ever done.


CU HOLDAWAY

HOLDAWAY
Was this vice squad bullshit in
Milwaukee?


JODIE

JODIE
No. The vice squad roust was in
L.A. He's been in Los Angeles
since '77.


DOLLY BEHIND HOLDAWAY'S DESK

from left to right.

FREDDY
When did he do this time?

JODIE
Back in '83, got out late '86. I
found something else out I think
you two should be aware of.
About a year and a half ago, up in
Sacramento, an undercover cop,
John Dolenz, worked his way into a
bank job. Apparently before the
job they found out he was a cop.
Now picture this: It's Dolenz's
birthday, a bunch of cops are
waiting in his apartment for a
surprise party. The door opens,
everyone yells "Surprise!", and
standing in the doorway is Dolenz
and this other guy sticking a gun
in Dolenz's ribs. Before anybody
knows what's going on, this
stranger shoots Dolenz dead and
starts firing two .45 automatics
into the crowd.

HOLDAWAY
What happened?

The DOLLY moves behind Jodie.

JODIE
It was a mess. Cops got hit,
wives got hit, girlfriends got
hit, his dog got hit. People got
glass in their faces. Three were
killed, six were wounded.

FREDDY
They couldn't pin the killing on
one of the bank robbers?

JODIE
They tried, but they didn't have a
positive I.D. and all those guys
had alibis. Besides, we really
didn't have anything on them. We
had the testimony of a dead man
that they were talking
about committing a robbery. They
never went ahead with the bank
job.

The DOLLY completes its circle.

FREDDY
And Larry Dimick was one of the
boys?

JODIE
He was probably the one.


ON HOLDAWAY

HOLDAWAY
Just how sure are you with your
cover?

PAN to C.U. on Freddy.

FREDDY
Today they may know something,
tomorrow they may know something
else. But yesterday they didn't
know anything.

FREDDY (OS)
What's the next step?

HOLDAWAY (OS)
Do what they told ya. Sit in your

Nice Guy places the receiver back in its cradle.

EDDIE
He'll be right down.


39 INT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

The CAMERA follows Freddy as he hops around the
apartment getting everything he needs. He puts on
his jacket and slips on some sneakers.

DOLLY fast toward the front door knob. Freddy's hand
comes into FRAME, grabs the knob, then lets go. We MOVE
UP to his face.

Fear.

FREDDY
(to himself)
Don't pussy out on me now. They
don't know. They don't know shit.
(pause)
You're not gonna get hurt. You're
fucking Baretta and they believe
every word, cuz
you're super cool.

He exits FRAME. We stay put and hear the door open and
close OFF SCREEN.

COPS watching Freddy see him walk out of his building and
up to Eddie's parked car.

There goes our boy.

COP #2 (OS)
I swear, a guy has to have rocks
in his head the size of Gibraltar

COP #1 (OS)
Do you want one of these?

COP #2 (OS)
Yeah, gimme the bear claw.

Freddy gets into the car and it pulls into traffic.

Cop #1 starts the engine and follows.


41 INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Nice Guy Eddie is behind the wheel. Mr. Pink is
in the passenger seat. Freddy and Mr. White are in the
backseat together.

MR. PINK
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin
about, black women ain't the same
as white women.

MR. WHITE
(sarcastically)
There's a slight difference.

The car laughs.

MR. PINK
Go ahead and laugh, you know what
I mean. What a while bitch will
put up with, a black bitch won't
put up with for a minute. They
got a line, and if you cross it,
they fuck you up.

EDDIE
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on
this. I've seen it happen.

MR. WHITE
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such
a truism, how come every nigger I
know treats his woman like a piece
of shit?

MR. PINK
I'll make you a bet that those
same damn niggers who were showin
their ass in public, when their
bitches get 'em home, they chill
the fuck out.

MR. WHITE
Not these guys.

MR. PINK
Yeah, those guys too.

EDDIE
Let me tell you guys a story. In
one of daddy's clubs there was
this black cocktail waitress named
Elois.

MR. WHITE
Elois?

EDDIE
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We
called her Lady E.

MR. WHITE
Where was she from, Compton?

EDDIE
No. She was from Ladora Heights.

MR. PINK
The black Beverly Hills. I knew
this lady from Ladora Heights
once.
(in a stuck up black
female voice)
"Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's
the black Beverly Hills."
EDDIE
It's not the black Beverly Hills,
it's the black Palos Verdes.
Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a
man-eater-upper. I bet every guy
who's ever met her has jacked off
to her at least once. You know
who she looked like? Christie
Love. 'Member that TV show "Get
Christie Love"? She was a black
female cop. She always used to
say "You're under arrest, sugar."

MR. PINK
I was in the sixth grade when that
show was on. I totally dug it.
What the fuck was the name of the
chick who played Christie
Love?

EDDIE
Pam Grier.

MR. PINK
No, it wasn't Pan Grier, Pan Grier
was the other one. Pan Grier made
the movies. Christie Love was
like a Pam Grier TV show, without
Pam Grier.

MR. PINK
What the fuck was that chick's
name? Oh this is just great, I'm
totally fuckin tortured now.

EDDIE
Well, whoever she was, Elois
looked like her. So one night I
walk into the club, and no Elois.
Now the bartender was a wetback,
he was a friend of mine, his name
was Carlos.
So I asked him "Hey, Carlos,
where's Lady E tonight?" Well
apparently Lady E was married to
this real piece of dog shit. I
mean a real animal. And
apparently he would so things to
her.

FREDDY

Do things? What would he do? You
mean like beat her up?

EDDIE
Nobody knows for sure what he did.
We just know he did something.
Anyway, Elois plays it real cool.
And waits for the next time this
bag of shit gets drunk. So one
night the guy gets drunk and
passes out on the couch. So while
the guy's
inebriated, she strips him naked.
Then she takes some crazy glue and
glues his dick to his belly.

The car reacts to how horrible that would be.

EDDIE
I'm dead fuckin serious. She put
some on his dick and some on his
belly, then stuck 'em together.
The paramedics had to come and cut
it loose.

The car reacts badly.

MR. WHITE
Jesus Christ!

FREDDY
You can do some crazy things with
it.

EDDIE
I don't know what he did to her,
but she got even.

MR. WHITE
Was he all pissed off?

MR. PINK
How would you feel if you had to
do a handstand every time you took
a piss.

The car laughs.


42 EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

Nice Guy Eddie pulls up outside the warehouse.
The four men climb out of the car and follow Eddie inside.


43 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The four men enter the building.

At the other end of the warehouse, sitting in chairs, are
Mr. Blonde, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue and Joe Cabot.

We shoot this from OVERHEAD, looking down on the men.

JOE
(to everybody)
...So they're talkin about how
they get their wives off, and the
French guys says:
(in a bad French
accent)
"All I gotta do is take my pinky
and tickle my Fifi's little oo la
la and she rises a foot off the
bed."

Back to Joe.

So the dago says:


CU ON JOE

JOE
(in a good Brooklyn
accent)
"That's nothin. When I take the
tip of my tongue and wiggle it
against my Mary Louise's little
fun pimple, she rises two feet off
da bed." Then our friend from
Poland says:
(in dumb voice)
"You guys ain't no cocksmen. When
I get through fuckin my Sophie, I
wipe my dick on the curtains and
you know what? She hits the
roof!"

Joe laughs like a crazy man.

JOE
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

We hear a lot of laughing OFF SCREEN.

JOE
Ain't that a masterpiece? Stupid
fuckin Polack, wipes his dick on
the drapes.

Joe's eyes greet the new arrivals.

JOE
You're here, great!

Joe EXITS C.U.

We now have everybody from the Uncle Bob's Pancake House
scene together again. Some sit on folding chairs, some
stand. Joe sits in front of them on the edge of a table.
A blackboard with a layout of the jewelry store is off to
the right.

We do a 360 around the men.

EDDIE
We woulda gotten here sooner, but
we got backed up around La Brea
and Pico.

JOE
No hurry.
(to the boys)
All right, let's get to know one
another. With the exception of
Eddie and myself, who you already
know, you'll be using aliases.
Under no circumstances are you to
tell one another your real name or
anything else about yourself.
That includes where you're from,
your wife's name, where you
might've done time, about a bank
in St. Petersburg you might've
robbed. You guys don't say shit
about who you are, where you been
or what you've done. Only thing
you guys can talk about is what
you're going to do. This way the
only ones who know who the members
of the team are are Eddie and
myself. And that's the way I like
it. Because in the unlikely event
of one of you getting apprehended
by the cops, not that I expect
that to happen - it most
definitely should not happen - it
hasn't happened, you don't have
anything to deal with. You don't
know any names. You know my name,
you know Eddie's name. That I
don't care about. You gotta prove
it. I ain't worried. Besides,
this way you gotta trust me. I
like that. I set this up and
picked the men I wanted for it.
None of you came to me, I
approached all of you. I know
you. I know your work, I know
your reputation. I know you as
men. Except for this guy.

Joe points a finger at Freddy.

Freddy shits a brick.

JOE
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he
wouldn't be here. Okay, let me
introduce everybody to everybody.
But once again, at the risk of
being redundant, if I even think I
hear somebody telling or referring
to somebody by their Christian
name...
(Joe searches for the
right words)
...you won't want to be you.
Okay, quickly.
(pointing at the men
as he gives them a
name)
Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde,
Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr.
Pink.

MR. PINK
Why am I Mr. Pink?

JOE
Cause you're a faggot.

Everybody laughs.

MR. PINK
Why can't we pick out our own
colors?

JOE
I tried that once, it don't work.
You get four guys fighting over
who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since
nobody knows anybody else, nobody
wants to back down. So forget it,
I pick. Be thankful you're not
Mr. Yellow.

MR. BROWN
Yeah, but Mr. Brown? That's too
close to Mr. Shit.

Everybody laughs.

MR. PINK
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr.
Pussy. Tell you what, let me be
Mr. Purple. That sounds good to
me, I'm Mr. Purple.

JOE
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody
from another job's Mr. Purple.
You're Mr. Pink.

MR. WHITE
Who cares what your name is? Who
cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr.
Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...

MR. PINK
Oh that's really easy for you to
say, you're Mr. White. You gotta
cool-sounding name. So tell me,
Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink"
is no big deal, you wanna trade?

JOE
Nobody's trading with anybody!
Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin
city counsel meeting! Listen up
Mr. Pink. We got two ways here,
my way or the highway. And you
can go down either of 'em. So
what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?

MR. PINK
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin forget
it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr.
Pink, let's move on.

CAMERA leaves the team and goes to the blackboard
with the layout of the jewelry store on it.

JOE (OS)
Okay fellas, let's get into this.

CUT TO:


44 EXT. BLEACHERS - DAY

Freddy and Holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty
little league baseball field.

HOLDAWAY
Okay, we're gonna station men
across the street from Karina's
Fine Jewelry. But their orders
will be not to move in unless the
robbery gets out of control. You
gotta make sure they don't have to
move in. You're inside to make
sure that everything goes
according to Hoyle. We have men
set up a block away from the
warehouse rendezvous. They got
complete visibility of the
exterior. So as soon as Joe Cabot
shows up, we'll see it.

FREDDY
What's your visibility of the
interior?

HOLDAWAY
We can't see shit on the inside.
And we can't risk gettin any
closer for fear they'll spot us.

FREDDY
This is bullshit, Jim. I get all
the fuckin danger of having you
guys in my back pocket but none of
the safety.

HOLDAWAY
What's the matter, Newendyke? Job
too tough for ya? No one lied to
you. You always knew we'd hang
back until Joe Cabot showed up.

FREDDY
Oh this is great. You ain't
giving me no fuckin protection
whatsoever. But you are giving me
an attitude.

HOLDAWAY
Since when does an undercover cop
have protection? Freddy, you came
into this thing with your eyes
wide open, so don't start screamin
blind man now. I understand
you're nervous. I wish the
warehouse had more visible
windows, but it doesn't. We have
to make do with the cards we're
dealt.

FREDDY
I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it.
I'm just remarking on how shitty
the situation is!

HOLDAWAY
I don't mean to be harsh with ya,
but I've found tough love works
best in these situations. We have
to get Joe Cabot in the company of
the thieves and in the same
vicinity as the loot.
We don't care about these other
bastards. We're willing to offer
them good deals to testify against
Cabot.

FREDDY
Isn't this risk unorthodox?

HOLDAWAY
What?

FREDDY
Letting them go ahead with the
robbery?

HOLDAWAY
The whole idea behind this
operation is to catch Joe Cabot
red-handed. We bust these hired
hands, we ain't accomplished shit.
Letting them go through with the
heist is a risk, but Cabot's jobs
are very clean. We got people
surrounding the perimeter. We got
a guy and a gal on the inside
posing as a couple shopping for
rings. We could replace the
employees with cops, but we'd run
the risk of tipping 'em off.

FREDDY
That's out. They know the faces
of who works what shift.

HOLDAWAY
These guys are professionals.
We're professionals. It's a risk,
but I think it's a calculated
risk.

We see MOS SHOTS of the outside of the jewelry store.

CUSTOMERS coming and going. STORE CLERKS waiting on
customers through the windows.

While we look at this we HEAR over the soundtrack Mr.
White and Freddy talking OFF SCREEN.

MR. WHITE (VO)
Let's go over it. Where are you?

FREDDY (VO)
I stand outside and guard the
door. I don't let anybody come in
or go out.

MR. WHITE (VO)
Mr. Brown?

FREDDY (VO)
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's
parked across the street till I
give him the signal, then he pulls
up in front of the store.

MR. WHITE (VO)
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?

FREDDY (VO)
Crowd control. They handle
customers and employees in the
display area.


46 INT. MR. WHITE'S CAR (PARKED) - DAY

Mr. White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street
from the jewelry store, staking it out.

MR. WHITE
Myself and Mr. Pink?

FREDDY
You two take the manager in the
back and make him give you the
diamonds. We're there for those
stones, period. Since no display
cases are being fucked with, no
alarms should go off. We're out
of there in two minutes, not one
second longer. What if the
manager won't give up the
diamonds?

MR. WHITE
When you're dealing with a store
like this, they're insured up the
ass. They're not supposed to give
you and resistance
whatsoever. If you get a customer
or an employee who thinks he's
Charles Bronson, take the butt of
your gun and smash their nose in.
Drops 'em right to the floor.
Everyone jumps, he falls down,
screaming, blood squirts out his
nose. Freaks everybody out.
Nobody says fuckin shit after
that. You might get some bitch
talk shit to ya. But give her a
look, like you're gonna smash her
in the face next. Watch her shut
the fuck up. Now if it's a
manager, that's a different story.
The managers know better than to
fuck around. So if one's givin
you static, he probably thinks
he's a real cowboy. So what you
gotta do is break that son-of-a-
bitch in two. If you wanna know
something and he won't tell you,
cut off one of his fingers. The
little one. Then you tell 'im his
thumb's next. After that he'll
tell ya if he wears ladies
underwear. I'm hungry, let's get
a taco.

CUT TO:


47 EXT. ALLEY - DAY

It's the moment of the robbery. The alley is empty.

In the distance we hear all hell breaking loose. Guns
FIRING, people SHOUTING and SCREAMING, sirens WAILING,
glass BREAKING...

A car whips around the corner, into the alley.

The doors BURST open, Freddy and Mr. White hop out.

Freddy opens the driver's side door. A bloody SCREAMING
Mr. Brown FALLS out.

MR. BROWN
(screaming)
My eyes! My eyes! I'm blind, I'm
fucking blind!

FREDDY
You're not blind, there's just
blood in your eyes.

Mr. White loads his two .45 automatics. He RUNS to the
end of the alley just as a police car comes into SIGHT.

FIRING both .45's, Mr. White massacres everyone in the
patrol car.

Freddy, holding the dying Mr. Brown, looks on at Mr.
White's ambush in shock.

Mr. Brown lifts his head up, blood in his eyes.

MR. BROWN
Mr. Orange? You're Mr. Orange,
aren't you?

By the time Freddy turns his head back to him, Mr. Brown
is dead.

Mr. White RUNS up to Freddy.

MR. WHITE
Is he dead?

Freddy doesn't answer, he can't.

MR. WHITE
Did he did or not?

Freddy, scared.

FREDDY
I'm sorry.

MR. WHITE
What? Snap out of it!

Mr. White GRABS Freddy by the coat and YANKS him along as
he RUNS.

They EXIT the alley and FLEE down a street.

A car with a FEMALE DRIVER comes up on the two men.

Mr. White JUMPS in her path, stopping the car. He points
his jun at her.

MR. WHITE
Get us outta here!

Mr. White climbs into the backseat.

Freddy starts to climb in.

The Female driver comes up with a gun from under her seat.

MR. WHITE
The bitch's got a gun!

She SHOOTS Freddy in the stomach.

On instinct Freddy brings up his gun and SHOOTS her in the
face.


C.U. ON FREDDY

as he FALLS to the ground he realizes what's happened
to him and what he's done. SLOW MOTION.

Mr White DRAGS the dead female driver out of the car. He
SHOVES Freddy in the backseat and DRIVES away.


48 INT. GETAWAY CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Freddy holding his stomach and doubled over in pain is
CRYING.

We replay the scene between Freddy and Mr. White in the
getaway car. Except this time, we never leave Freddy.

MR. WHITE (OS)
Just hold on buddy boy.

FREDDY
I'm sorry. I can't believe she
killed me...


CUT FROM FREDDY IN THE BACKSEAT TO:


49 INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Mr. Pink is behind the wheel, Nice Guy Eddie is in the
passenger seat going through the satchel with the
diamonds. Mr. White is in the backseat. The car is
SPEEDING back to the garage.

EDDIE
(looking through the
case)
You know, all things considered,
this was pretty successful.

MR. WHITE
I don't believe you just said
that.

EDDIE
No, it was messy as hell, but do
you realize how much you got away
with? There's over two million
dollars worth of diamonds here.

MR. PINK
I love this guy.

EDDIE
Hey, what's done is done. We can
all sit around and have a big cry
about it or we can deal with the
situation at hand.

MR. WHITE
The situation as hand isn't that
fuckin satchel. You and Joe have
a responsibility to your men.

EDDIE
Hey, it's the best I could do.

MR. WHITE
The man is fucking dying.

EDDIE
And I'm telling you, Bonnie'll
take care of him.

MR. WHITE
He needs a doctor, not a fuckin
nurse.

EDDIE
Ask me how many doctors I called.
You wanna embarrass yourself, ask
me how many doctors I called.

MR. WHITE
Obviously not enough.

EDDIE
Fuck you! You gotta little black
book, then whip is out. If not,
listen how it is. I called three
doctors and couldn't get through
to shit. Now, time being a
factor, I called Bonnie. Sweet
broad, helluva broad, and a
registered nurse. Told her a
bullshit story, upside: she said
bring him to her apartment.

MR. WHITE
If he dies I'm holding you
personally responsible.

EDDIE
Fuck you buddy boy! Okay, you
wanna play that way. I am
personally leaving myself
vulnerable with this Bonnie
situation. I don't think she'll
call the cops, but I don't know
for sure. But me being too nice-
a-fuckin-guy was willin to risk
it. But no fuckin more.
(he grabs his
portable phone)
I'm callin Bonnie back and tellin
her to forget it. You take care
of your friend, you know so much
about it.

MR. PINK
Goddamnit, will you guys grow up!

EDDIE
I don't need to grow up, my
friend. I am a grown up. I'm
being responsible, I'm taking care
of business.

MR. WHITE
Cut the shit! I don't think you
called anybody except some cooze
you once fucked, who happens to
wear orthopedic shoes. And I
don't think that's good enough
care for a gut-shot man.

EDDIE
Yeah, well I don't give a flying
fuck what you think!

MR. PINK
(to Mr. White)
Look, he's not sayin this bitch is
gonna operate on him. She's gonna
give him better attention than we
can until we can get a doctor.
Nobody's forgotten about doctors.
Joe'll get one in a snap. This is
something we're doing in the
meantime. I think both of you are
actin like a couple of assholes.

EDDIE
Yeah, right. I arrange a nurse, I
leave myself wide open, and I'm an
asshole.


50 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

MEDIUM SHOT on the door. Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and
Mr. Pink walk through it. They stop in their tracks.

We see what they see. Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground,
shot full of holes. The cop slumped over in his chair, a
bloody mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding
his wound. Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the
shot.

EDDIE
What the fuck happened here?

Eddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde/Toothpick Vic.

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Orange)
What happened?

MR. ORANGE
(very weakly)
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the
cop's face, cut off his ear and
was gonna burn him alive.

EDDIE
(yelling)
Who cares what he was gonna do to
this fuckin pig?

Eddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop. The cop and
the chair tip over. Eddie stands over him and SHOOTS him
once more.

EDDIE
(to Mr. Orange)
You were saying he went crazy?
Something like that? Worse or
better?

MR. ORANGE
Look, Eddie, he was pullin a burn.
He was gonna kill the cop and me.
And when you guys walked through
the door, he was gonna blow you to
hell and make off with the
diamonds.

MR. WHITE
(to Eddie)
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya?
That sick piece of shit was a
stone cold psycho.

MR. ORANGE
(to Eddie)
You could've asked the cop, if you
didn't just kill him. He talked
about what he was going to do when
he was slicing him up.

EDDIE
I don't buy it. It doesn't make
sense.

MR. WHITE
It makes perfect fuckin sense to
me. Eddie, you didn't see how he
acted during the job, we did.

Mr. Pink walks over to the cop's body.

MR. PINK
He's right about the ear, it's
hacked off.

EDDIE
(to Mr. Orange)
Let me say this out loud, just to
get it straight in my mind.
According to you, Mr. Blonde was
gonna kill you. Then when we came
back, kill us, grab the diamonds,
and scram. That's your story?
I'm correct about that, right?

MR. ORANGE
Eddie, you can believe me or not
believe me, but it's the truth. I
swear on my mother's eternal soul
that's what happened.

The CAMERA mover into a C.U. of Nice Guy Eddie.

There's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange
has said. Finally:

EDDIE
You're a fuckin liar. Now why
don't you drop the fuckin fairy
tale and tell me what really
happened?

MR. WHITE (OS)
He told you what really happened.
You just can't deal with it.

MR. ORANGE (OS)
Okay, you're right, I'm lying.
Even though I'm fuckin dyin I'm
not above pullin a fast one. Get
rid of Blonde, we share his split
- no, scratch that, I shot him
'cause I didn't like his hair
style. I didn't like his shoes
either. If it has just been his
hair, I'd've maybe, maybe I said,
let him live. But hair and
footwear together, he's a goner.

EDDIE
The man you killed was just
released from prison. He got
caught at a company warehouse full
of hot items. He could've walked
away. All he had to do was say my
dad's name. But instead he shut
his mouth and did his time. He
did four years for us, and he did
'em like a man. And we were very
grateful. So, Mr. Orange, you're
tellin me this very good friend of
mine, who did four years for my
father, who in four years never
made a deal, no matter what they
dangled in front of him, you're
telling me that now, that now this
man is free, and we're making good
on our commitment to him, he's
just gonna decide, right out of
the fuckin blue, to rip us off?

Silence.

EDDIE
Mr. Orange, why don't you tell me
what really happened?

VOICE (OS)
Why? It'll just be more bullshit.

Eddie steps out of his C.U. and we see Joe Cabot standing
in the warehouse doorway. He walks into the room.

JOE
(pointing to Mr.
Orange)
This man set us up.

CAMERA does a 360 around the men.

EDDIE
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know
what's happening.

JOE
That's okay, Eddie, I do.

MR. WHITE
(to Joe)
What the fuck are you talking
about?

JOE
(pointing to Mr.
Orange)
That piece of shit. Workin with
the cops.

MR. WHITE MR. PINK EDDIE
What?

JOE
I said this lump of shit is workin
with the LAPD.


MR. ORANGE'S POV

Looking up from the floor at everybody.

Joe looks down at Mr. Orange.

JOE
Aren't you?

MR. ORANGE (OS)
I don't have the slightest fuckin
idea what you're talkin about.

MR. WHITE
(very calmly to Joe)
Joe, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.

JOE
Like hell I am.

MR. WHITE
(very calmly)
Joe, trust me on this, you've made
a mistake. He's a good kid. I
understand you're hot, you're
super-fuckin pissed. We're all
real emotional. But you're
barking up the wrong tree. I know
this man, and he wouldn't do that.

JOE
You don't know jack shit. I do.
This rotten bastard tipped off the
cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr.
Blue killed.

MR. PINK
Mr. Blue's dead?

JOE
Dead as Dillinger.

EDDIE
The motherfucker killed Vic.

MR. WHITE
How do you know all this?

JOE
He was the only one I wasn't a
hundred percent on. I should have
my fucking head examined for goin
forward when I wasn't a hundred
percent. But he seemed like a
good kid, and I was impatient and
greedy and all the things that
fuck you up.

MR. WHITE
(screaming)
That's your proof?

JOE
You don't need proof when you got
instinct. I ignored it before,
but not no more.

He WHIPS out a revolver and aims it at Mr. Orange.

Mr. White brings his .45 up at Joe.

Eddie and Mr. Pink are shook awake by the flash of
firearms.

Eddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr. White.

EDDIE
Have you lost your fucking mind?
Put your gun down!

Mr. Pink fades into the B.G., wanting no part of this.

MR. WHITE
Joe, you're making a terrible
mistake I can't let you make.

EDDIE
Stop pointing your fuckin gun at
daddy!

Joe, never taking his eyes off Mr. Orange.

JOE
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry
have been friends a long time, he
ain't gonna shoot. We like each
other too much.

MR. WHITE
Joe, if you kill that man, you die
next. Repeat, if you kill that
man, you die next!

We get many different angles of the Mexican standoff.


MEDIUMS ON EVERYBODY

Mr. Orange holding his belly, looking from left to right.

Joe pointing down on Mr. Orange. Not taking his eyes off
him.

Mr. White pointing at Joe, looking like he's ready to
start firing any minute.

Eddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on Mr.
White.

Mr. Pink walking backwards away from the action.

Nobody says nothing.


FOUR SHOT

of guys ready for violence. Mr. Pink in the B.G.

MR. PINK
C'mon, guys, nobody wants this.
We're supposed to me fuckin
professionals!

Joe raises his head to Mr. White.

JOE
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.

MR. WHITE
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do
this!

JOE
Larry, I'm askin you to trust me
on this.

MR. WHITE
Don't ask me that.

JOE
I'm not askin, I'm betting.

Joe's eyes go back to Mr. Orange.

EDDIE
Daddy, don't!

Joe FIRES three times, HITTING Mr. Orange with every one.

Mr. White SHOOTS Joe twice in the face. Joe brings his
hands up to his face, screaming, and falls to the ground.

Eddie FIRES at Mr. White, HITTING him three times in the
chest.

Mr. White brings his gun around on Eddie and SHOOTS him.

The two men FALL to their knees, FIRING at each other.

Eddie COLLAPSES, dead.

Joe's dead.

Mr. Orange lies perfectly still, except for his chest
heaving. The only SOUND we hear is his loud breathing.

Mr. White is SHOT full of holes, but still on his knees,
not moving.

Mr. Pink is standing motionless. Finally he grabs the
satchel of diamonds and RUNS out the door.

We hear outside a CAR START. Then the SOUND of a BULLHORN
yells out:

POLICE FORCE (OS)
Freeze! Get out of the car and lie
face down on the ground!

MR. PINK (OS)
Don't shoot!

We now hear SIRENS, the SOUNDS of more CARS DRIVING UP,
MEN RUNNING to the warehouse.

While all this noise is going on, Mr. White tries to stand
but FALLS DOWN. He somehow makes it to where Mr. Orange
lies.

He lifts Mr. Orange's head, cradling it in his lap and
stroking his brow.

MR. WHITE
(with much effort)
Sorry, kid. Looks like we're
gonna do a little time.

Mr. Orange looks up at him and, with even more of an
effort:

MR. ORANGE
I'm a cop.

Mr. White doesn't say anything, he keeps stroking Orange's
brow.

MR. ORANGE
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

Mr. White lifts his .45 and places the barrel between Mr.
Orange's eyes.

The CAMERA MOVES into an EXTREME C.U. of Mr White.

The SOUNDS of outside STORM inside. We don't see
anything, but we HEAR a bunch of shotguns COCKING.

POLICE FORCE (OS)
Freeze, motherfucker! Drop your
fucking gun!

Mr White looks up at them, smiles, PULLS the trigger.

BANG

We hear a BURST of SHOTGUN FIRE.

Mr. White is BLOWN out of frame, leaving it empty.
